* [The Bangkok Urbanscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding Using Deep Learning](https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/bkkurbanscapes)
  * To further study self-driving cars in Thailand, we provide both the proposed methods and the proposed dataset in this project. We hope that our architecture and our dataset would help self-driving autonomous developers improve systems for driving in many cities with unique traffic and driving conditions similar to Bangkok and elsewhere in Thailand.

* [Object Detection of Road Assets Using Transformer-Based YOLOX with Feature Pyramid Decoder on Thai Highway Panorama](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/13/1/5)
  * Identifying road asset objects in Thailand highway monitoring image sequences is essential for intelligent traffic monitoring and administration of the highway. We introduce transformer-based Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) decoder designs, injecting the FPN style of decoder design into Transformer-based YOLOX reasoning.

* [Geospatial Big Data Analytics 2022](https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/files/talks/panboonyuen_Geospatial_Big_Data_Analytics_2022.jpeg)
  * Demonstrate an understanding of the breadth of methods and techniques available for handling large volumes of geospatial data; use AI/ML methods with PySpark and techniques to conduct spatial analyses of big data and apply resulting analyses to problems within the student’s own discipline.
