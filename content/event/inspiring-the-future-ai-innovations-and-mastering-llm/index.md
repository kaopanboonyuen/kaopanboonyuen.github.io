summary: I had the opportunity to give a final orientation speech to the undergraduate students of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at KMUTNB. The focus of my speech was on the transformative impact of AI, particularly highlighting the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. I discussed how these models have revolutionized natural language processing, enabling sophisticated interactions and problem-solving capabilities. Emphasizing the importance of mastering AI tools, I encouraged students to develop strong prompting skills to effectively control and harness the potential of AI technologies. The future of AI holds immense possibilities, and by staying adept at these emerging trends, students can significantly contribute to the field and drive innovation.
