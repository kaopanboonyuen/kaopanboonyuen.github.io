title: Distributed Machine Learning Techniques for Geospatial Data

event: Teaching Distributed Machine Learning at GISTDA
event_url: #https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=traKBhJm4lQ

location: Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA)
<!-- address:
  street: 450 Serra Mall
  city: Stanford
  region: CA
  postcode: '94305'
  country: United States -->

summary: I was invited to teach a course on distributed machine learning to the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA). The curriculum covered fundamental concepts of PySpark, basic deep learning techniques, and practical applications of distributed training using TensorFlow. I also emphasized methods for leveraging Multi-GPU setups and implementing distributed training strategies, particularly in the context of geospatial data analytics, equipping participants with the skills needed to handle large-scale machine learning tasks efficiently.
