summary: My thesis defense at the Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University. This dissertation introduces a new architecture for remote sensing, featuring Global Convolutional Network (GCN), channel attention, domain-specific transfer learning, Feature Fusion (FF), and Depthwise Atrous Convolution (DA). Tests on Landsat-8 and ISPRS Vaihingen datasets show that this model significantly outperforms the baseline.
