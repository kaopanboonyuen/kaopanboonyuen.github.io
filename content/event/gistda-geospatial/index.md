summary: Geospatial Data Analytics involves analyzing spatial and geographical data to gain insights and make informed decisions. Using PySpark, this process is accelerated through distributed computing, enabling the handling of large datasets efficiently. Distributed Machine Learning models further enhance the analysis by providing scalable and robust predictions. Visualization tools like Looker Studio present the analyzed data in an interactive and comprehensible format, facilitating better decision-making and strategic planning. This combination of technologies allows for comprehensive geospatial data analysis, uncovering patterns and trends that drive actionable insights.
