summary: I was invited to speak at the "Achieve Data Science First Meet" for a MOOC student project event, where I highlighted the growing recognition of data science, AI, and machine learning's importance across various industries. I advised that organizations, regardless of their size or sector, must effectively develop and implement data science capabilities to stay competitive in the era of big data, or risk falling behind.
