> In the realm of **AI vision**, my heart takes flight,  
Not in the spectrum of colors or vibrant light.  
But in the elegance of a single band’s view,  
Where grayscale or black-and-white holds the clue.  

> My journey mirrors this, clear and precise,  
A singular focus amidst complexity's slice.  
Though color may dazzle and images gleam,  
It's the simplicity in shades that fuels my dream.
