My first was the Bangkok Marathon 2022, but this time, it felt even more meaningful as I returned to my hometown, Ratchaburi, to take on the challenge. Despite being born here, it wasn’t until now—at the age of 30—that I finally had the chance to run this iconic race in my own backyard.\nThe Chombueng Marathon, now in its 38th year, is one of Thailand’s oldest and most cherished marathons. It’s not just a race; it’s a tradition that brings together runners from across the country and beyond, while showcasing the unique charm of this small but spirited district.\nThe Journey Back Home Coming back to Chombueng brought back a flood of childhood memories. Growing up, I spent countless weekends visiting my mom, who worked as a teacher here. The tranquil forests, the famous Tham Chomphon cave, the peaceful campus of Rajabhat University Chombueng—they’ve all remained beautifully unchanged. Running through these familiar sights made the experience even more special, as if the past and present collided in the best possible way.\nThe Race The 2025 Chombueng Marathon was held on January 19th, with the gun going off for the 42.195K runners at 3:00 a.m.. The weather was perfect for running, hovering between 15–19°C—cool and crisp, just the way I like it.\nI started off strong, clocking a 5:39 average pace for the first 5K, easing slightly to 5:54 for the next 10K. By the time I reached the halfway point at 21K, I was feeling good, finishing the first half in just over 2 hours. But as the second half began, I shifted gears to a more strategic approach: run-walk intervals. I wanted to finish this race injury-free and with enough energy to enjoy the rest of the day—because life’s too short to spend it limping around post-race!\nIn the end, I crossed the finish line with a chip time of 5 hours and 36 minutes. While it wasn’t a personal best or a sub-5, the sense of accomplishment and joy I felt was unbeatable.\nThe Magic of Chombueng What truly sets the Chombueng Marathon apart is the atmosphere and community spirit. The entire town comes alive for this event, cheering runners on from start to finish.\nI’ll always remember the monks sprinkling holy water on us as we ran by—a uniquely Thai tradition that made me smile every time. Then there were the students, standing by the roadside in the early hours, clapping, cheering, and offering encouragement. And, of course, the locals who came out to support us, their smiles and shouts of \u0026ldquo;สู้ ๆ!\u0026rdquo; (Keep going!) giving us the boost we needed to push through each kilometer.\nTo everyone who stood out in the cool morning air to cheer us on: thank you. Your energy, enthusiasm, and kindness made all the difference.\nThe Race Atmosphere This year’s marathon was filled with joy and excitement. I met so many incredible runners, each radiating energy and enthusiasm as we gathered at the start line at 3 a.m. The crowd was electric, with smiles all around and cheers that warmed the cool morning air. The support from the spectators was truly special, and I want to give a big shoutout to two amazing women who became unexpected guides during my race.\nDressed in vibrant orange and blue shirts, these two seasoned runners unknowingly set the perfect pace for me during the first 15K. With their steady rhythm, I was able to maintain a comfortable 5:50 min/km pace, which kept me going without overexerting myself. Though I hadn’t trained much and had no particular strategy in mind, following them gave me the boost I needed to tackle the early stages of the marathon.\nHowever, reality hit midway—I realized that sustaining that pace for the rest of the race was beyond my current fitness level. Adjusting my strategy, I had to let go of my hopes for a sub-4 finish, but I’m incredibly grateful to those two women for helping me start strong.\nIn the end, I crossed the finish line in 5 hours and 38 minutes. While it wasn’t the time I dreamed of, it was still a proud moment. Next time, I know sub-4 isn’t too far out of reach. Here’s to continuing the journey and pushing myself to new limits!\nLessons and Reflections This was my second full marathon, and while I didn’t hit my sub-5 goal, I’m proud of what I achieved. I went into this race with very little training—my recent runs had mostly been short 5Ks. But this marathon reignited my passion for running and reminded me why I love this sport so much.\nThe biggest lesson? It’s okay to let go of the pressure. Instead of obsessing over times and splits, I focused on enjoying the journey, listening to my body, and soaking in the experience. Running should be fun, and as long as you keep moving forward with a smile, that’s what matters.\nI know there are more full marathons in my future. And when the next one comes around, I’ll be ready.\nA Love Letter to Chombueng The Chombueng Marathon isn’t just a race—it’s a memory, a tradition, and a piece of my heart. Running in my hometown, surrounded by the places and people that shaped my early years, was an experience I’ll always treasure.\nThank you, Chombueng, for the beautiful scenery, the incredible community, and the unforgettable memories. This race will forever hold a special place in my heart, and I can’t wait to come back again.\nUntil next time, Chombueng.\nCitation Panboonyuen, Teerapong. (Feb 2024). The Day I Became an IRONMAN.

As a Turing Award Laureate and an expert in cryptography and artificial intelligence, his lecture was truly thought-provoking. The topic, “Can you recover a deep neural network from its answers?”, delved into one of the most critical questions of our time—how deep learning models, which are at the forefront of AI, can be understood and potentially reverse-engineered.\nThe lecture began with a discussion on the architecture of modern neural networks, emphasizing their complexity and overparameterization. Professor Shamir explored concepts like model inversion, adversarial attacks, and the limitations of current AI systems, while raising questions about privacy-preserving AI and ethical AI frameworks. His insights on adversarial robustness and explainable AI deeply resonated with my research interests, motivating me to reflect on these critical challenges.\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become indispensable in modern AI applications, with billions of dollars and countless GPU hours invested in their training. These models are often deployed as \u0026ldquo;black boxes,\u0026rdquo; allowing users to interact with them without revealing their inner workings. However, this raises a critical question: Can the parameters of a deep neural network be recovered using only its inputs and outputs? In a groundbreaking plenary lecture, Turing Award recipient Prof. Adi Shamir demonstrated that for ReLU-based DNNs, it is indeed possible to recover all parameters in polynomial time relative to the number of neurons. His findings, supported by practical experiments, highlight both the potential vulnerabilities of these systems and the need for robust defenses.\nUnderstanding the Basics of DNN Operations At the heart of Shamir\u0026rsquo;s analysis lies a detailed understanding of how DNNs function. A DNN comprises multiple layers of neurons, each performing a series of linear transformations followed by non-linear activations. Among these, the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is a widely used activation function defined as:\n$$ \\text{ReLU}(x) = \\max(0, x). $$\nThis piecewise linear function introduces non-linearity while maintaining computational simplicity. Shamir emphasized that ReLU\u0026rsquo;s linear segments make it particularly susceptible to parameter extraction, as its outputs can be mathematically analyzed to reveal underlying weights and biases.\nIn mathematical terms, the operation of a single layer in a DNN can be expressed as:\n$$ \\mathbf{y} = \\text{ReLU}(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}), $$\nwhere:\n$\\mathbf{x}$ represents the input vector, $\\mathbf{W}$ is the weight matrix, $\\mathbf{b}$ is the bias vector, and $\\mathbf{y}$ is the output vector after applying ReLU. Stacking multiple such layers creates a complex mapping from inputs to outputs, making the network appear opaque to external observers.\nChallenges in Parameter Recovery Recovering the parameters of a DNN—its weights and biases—is inherently an NP-hard problem. This complexity arises from the high dimensionality of the parameter space and the limited observability of internal computations. Traditional approaches to this problem relied on exhaustive searches, which scale exponentially with the number of parameters, rendering them impractical for large networks.\nProf. Shamir highlighted that these challenges are exacerbated in scenarios where outputs are restricted to discrete or low-precision values. However, he proposed that by carefully designing input queries and analyzing output patterns, it is possible to significantly simplify the recovery process.\nPolynomial Time Parameter Extraction Shamir\u0026rsquo;s key contribution lies in demonstrating a polynomial-time attack for ReLU-based DNNs. His approach leverages the inherent linearity of ReLU segments to derive equations that describe the network\u0026rsquo;s behavior. By identifying critical points—locations where ReLU outputs switch between active and inactive states—one can extract sufficient information to reconstruct the network\u0026rsquo;s parameters.\nCritical Points and Linear Equations Consider a single ReLU neuron with input $z$ and output $y = \\text{ReLU}(z)$. The critical point for this neuron is $z = 0$, where the output transitions from 0 to a positive value. By probing the network with carefully chosen inputs that traverse these critical points, it becomes possible to:\nIdentify the active/inactive state of each neuron. Extract linear equations relating the input, weights, and biases. For an $n$-layer network, these equations can be combined to solve for all parameters using standard techniques from linear algebra.\nPractical Demonstration In a practical demonstration, Shamir applied his method to an 8-layer DNN trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This network contained 1.2 million parameters, yet all were successfully recovered in polynomial time. The experiment underscores the real-world applicability of this attack and its implications for AI security.\nComparison with Cryptographic Systems Drawing parallels between DNNs and cryptographic systems, Shamir likened the structure of a neural network to a block cipher, where each layer performs a distinct transformation. In cryptography, security often hinges on the infeasibility of reversing these transformations without a key. Similarly, DNNs rely on the assumption that their internal parameters cannot be deduced from external interactions.\nHowever, Shamir\u0026rsquo;s work demonstrates that this assumption does not hold for ReLU-based networks. By exploiting the deterministic nature of their operations, an adversary can effectively \u0026ldquo;decrypt\u0026rdquo; the network to reveal its parameters.\nImplications of Randomness and Alternative Activations To mitigate the risks posed by such attacks, Shamir explored potential defenses, including:\nRandomness in Training and Inference: Introducing stochasticity into the network\u0026rsquo;s operations, such as random noise or dropout, can obscure critical points and complicate parameter recovery.\nAlternative Activation Functions: Functions like the sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent (tanh) introduce smoother transitions, reducing the linearity exploited in Shamir\u0026rsquo;s attack. The sigmoid function, for example, is defined as:\n$$ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}. $$\nUnlike ReLU, sigmoid outputs are continuous and bounded, making it harder to identify critical points.\nBroader Implications and Future Directions Shamir\u0026rsquo;s findings have profound implications for the field of AI security. As DNNs become integral to applications ranging from healthcare to autonomous systems, ensuring their robustness against parameter extraction attacks is paramount. Future research may focus on:\nDesigning architectures that are inherently resistant to such attacks. Developing formal metrics to quantify a network\u0026rsquo;s susceptibility to parameter recovery. Exploring the trade-offs between interpretability and security. In conclusion, Prof. Adi Shamir\u0026rsquo;s lecture sheds light on a critical vulnerability in modern AI systems while providing a roadmap for addressing it. His innovative use of cryptographic techniques underscores the interdisciplinary nature of AI research and its potential to reshape our understanding of security in the digital age.\nBut what truly stood out was the in-depth discussion I had with Professor Shamir. His monumental impact on the field of AI and his perspectives on current and future challenges was both a privilege and a learning experience that I will treasure forever.\nPlenary Lecture: Educability (Prof Leslie Valiant) In a captivating lecture, Prof. Leslie Valiant delved into the concept of educability, a framework that bridges the gap between human cognitive capabilities and machine learning. Drawing inspiration from Alan Turing’s groundbreaking insights, the discussion highlighted the interplay between intelligence, learning, and the ethical design of artificial intelligence systems.\nHistorical Foundations of Intelligence and Educability The quest to define human intelligence has long been fraught with challenges. Psychologists have struggled to agree on a single definition, revealing the complexity of human cognition. Prof. Valiant proposed that much of our understanding can be reframed through the lens of educability, which encompasses three primary facets:\nLearning from Experience ($\\mathcal{L}_{experience}$): The ability to generalize patterns and principles from observed phenomena. Reasoning with Acquired Knowledge ($\\mathcal{R}_{knowledge}$): Chaining learned concepts to make inferences. Absorbing Explicit Instruction ($\\mathcal{I}_{instruction}$): Gaining knowledge through direct teaching or guidance. These components have enabled humanity to progress from rudimentary tools to advanced technological civilizations.\nEducability vs. Machine Learning The Church-Turing Thesis A cornerstone of the lecture was the Church-Turing Thesis, which posits that all forms of computation—whether in human brains or machines—are fundamentally equivalent. This foundational idea underpins modern efforts to replicate human cognition in artificial intelligence.\nComparing Human and Machine Learning Current AI systems excel in pattern recognition and data-driven learning. However, they fall short in:\nContextual Reasoning: Humans can apply learned knowledge across diverse scenarios. For example, recognizing that if $A \\implies B$ and $B \\implies C$, then $A \\implies C$. Learning from Minimal Examples: Unlike humans, who can learn concepts from a few instances, AI often requires massive datasets. Instruction-Based Learning: Humans thrive in environments with structured instruction, a capability that AI systems struggle to emulate. Prof. Valiant argued that replicating these nuanced aspects of educability in AI could unlock new levels of machine intelligence.\nCognitive Capabilities as Civilization Enablers Human educability is unique among species, enabling the creation of advanced civilizations. This capability hinges on the ability to:\nGeneralize Across Domains: Applying principles learned in one context to solve problems in another. Accumulate Knowledge: Building on the work of previous generations through explicit instruction and documentation. Collaborate: Combining cognitive efforts to achieve collective goals. Ethical Implications of AI Development Prof. Valiant emphasized the ethical considerations in designing AI systems that reflect positive human traits while avoiding the replication of human flaws. Key takeaways included:\nAvoiding Bias: Ensuring that AI systems do not inherit societal biases. Transparent Decision-Making: Designing AI that can explain its reasoning processes. Augmenting Human Capabilities: Building systems that complement rather than replace human intelligence. Addressing Concerns About AI Accountability: Who is responsible for decisions made by AI systems? Safety: How do we ensure AI systems act in the best interest of humanity? Global Standards: The need for international cooperation to establish ethical guidelines. The Future of AI and Educability Prof. Valiant concluded with a vision for the future:\nInterdisciplinary Collaboration: Bringing together technologists, ethicists, and cognitive scientists to advance AI responsibly. Formalizing Educability: Developing mathematical models to encode human-like learning in machines. Human-Machine Collaboration: Leveraging AI to enhance human cognitive abilities, leading to breakthroughs in science, medicine, and technology. A Call to Action Understanding the parameters of educability is not just an academic pursuit; it is a moral imperative. By integrating insights from cognitive science, mathematics, and ethics, we can create AI systems that are not only intelligent but also aligned with human values.\nThis exploration of educability challenges us to rethink the foundations of intelligence and its implications for the future of artificial intelligence. As we navigate the complexities of AI development, let us be guided by the principles of transparency, accountability, and collaboration.\nPlenary Lecture: Compressing Proofs using Cryptography (Prof Yael Kalai) Cryptography has always been the backbone of secure systems, enabling trust in decentralized and distributed environments. As computation scales, the demand for efficient proof systems that ensure both correctness and privacy becomes increasingly important. Succinct proofs represent a groundbreaking development in this domain, offering compact, verifiable proofs that maintain efficiency and security.\nIn a recent lecture, Prof. Yael Tauman Kalai presented her advancements in succinct proofs, detailing their cryptographic foundations, practical implications, and applications in areas like blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). This blog unpacks her insights and explores how these proofs address modern computational challenges.\nWhat Are Succinct Proofs? Succinct proofs are cryptographic constructs designed to reduce the size and verification complexity of traditional proof systems. Instead of requiring a verifier to redo the entire computation to confirm its validity, succinct proofs enable verification with minimal computational effort. This efficiency is achieved without sacrificing security or trust, making them a critical tool for systems where scalability and privacy are paramount.\nUnlike traditional proof systems, which may involve large data sets and complex computations, succinct proofs achieve their compactness through advanced cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption, polynomial commitments, and elliptic curve cryptography. These techniques enable a prover to encode the essential details of a computation into a small, verifiable proof.\nKey Cryptographic Techniques Zero-Knowledge Proofs One of the core building blocks of succinct proofs is the concept of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). A ZKP allows a prover to convince a verifier that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond its validity. This ensures privacy while maintaining trust.\nFor example, in a blockchain transaction, a ZKP can prove the correctness of the transaction without disclosing the sender, receiver, or amount. This is particularly critical in privacy-preserving protocols like zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) and zk-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge).\nzk-SNARKs rely on a trusted setup to initialize the system. They use elliptic curve pairings and polynomial arithmetic to achieve their compactness. Despite their efficiency, the trusted setup requirement introduces potential vulnerabilities if compromised. zk-STARKs, on the other hand, eliminate the need for a trusted setup by relying on hash functions and polynomial interpolation. While this makes them more transparent and secure, they often result in larger proof sizes compared to zk-SNARKs. Polynomial Commitments Another crucial technique in succinct proofs is the use of polynomial commitments. These commitments enable the prover to encode computations as polynomials, allowing the verifier to check their correctness without directly interacting with the underlying data. Polynomial commitments are a cornerstone of many cryptographic protocols, including zk-STARKs and modern succinct proof systems.\nApplications of Succinct Proofs Blockchain Scalability One of the most impactful applications of succinct proofs is in blockchain technology. Blockchains, by design, require every participant to validate transactions to maintain trust. However, as the number of transactions grows, this validation becomes a bottleneck.\nSuccinct proofs offer a solution by enabling participants to verify the correctness of transactions without processing the full chain. Protocols like Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s Layer 2 solutions and Zcash leverage succinct proofs to improve scalability and maintain privacy.\nFor instance:\nRollups in Ethereum aggregate transactions off-chain and use succinct proofs to certify their correctness on-chain. Privacy-focused blockchains like Zcash use zk-SNARKs to enable shielded transactions, ensuring that details about the sender, receiver, and transaction amount remain confidential. AI Model Verification In the realm of AI, succinct proofs are emerging as a tool to certify the correctness of model outputs. As AI systems grow more complex, the ability to verify their decisions becomes a challenge. Succinct proofs can be used to generate a compact, verifiable record of an AI model’s decision-making process.\nFor example, in image classification tasks, a succinct proof could certify that the model correctly identified an object without requiring the verifier to process the entire dataset or model. This has profound implications for AI applications in critical domains like healthcare, where trust and accountability are paramount.\nDecentralized Identity Decentralized identity systems aim to give individuals control over their personal data while allowing them to prove certain attributes (e.g., age, citizenship) without revealing unnecessary details. Succinct proofs enable such systems by providing compact, privacy-preserving verifications.\nProtocols like Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) rely on these cryptographic techniques to ensure that identity verification is both efficient and secure.\nChallenges and Future Directions While succinct proofs offer significant advantages, they are not without challenges:\nTrusted Setup: zk-SNARKs require a trusted setup, which, if compromised, could undermine the security of the entire system. Research into transparent setups (as in zk-STARKs) aims to address this limitation.\nComputation Overhead: Although succinct proofs reduce verification complexity, the prover\u0026rsquo;s computational requirements can be high. Optimizing the proving process is an active area of research.\nInteroperability: For widespread adoption, succinct proof systems must integrate seamlessly with existing technologies. This involves developing standards and protocols that ensure compatibility across platforms.\nQuantum Resistance: As quantum computing advances, many cryptographic systems, including those used in succinct proofs, face potential vulnerabilities. Developing quantum-resistant proof systems is a critical area of ongoing research.\nInsights from Prof. Yael Tauman Kalai’s Research Prof. Kalai’s work pushes the boundaries of succinct proofs by exploring new cryptographic primitives and optimizing existing protocols. Her research emphasizes collaboration between academia and industry to address real-world challenges. Key areas of her focus include:\nEnhancing Transparency: Developing protocols that eliminate the need for trusted setups while maintaining efficiency and scalability. Improving Scalability: Optimizing proof generation to reduce computational overhead for the prover.

Succinct proofs represent a paradigm shift in cryptography, enabling efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving verification across various domains. From blockchain scalability to AI model verification, their potential applications are vast and transformative. However, realizing their full potential requires addressing challenges like computational overhead, interoperability, and quantum resistance.\nAs cryptographic research evolves, the collaboration between researchers, industry, and policymakers will be essential to unlock the full potential of succinct proofs. Prof. Kalai’s groundbreaking work serves as a testament to the importance of pushing the boundaries of what cryptography can achieve.\nEngaging in Dialogues on the Ethics of AI The summit wasn’t just about science and innovation—it also provided a platform to engage in crucial discussions about the ethical implications of technological advancements. One such discussion was the Panel Huddle titled “Ethics of Scientific Research in the Age of AI”, featuring prominent professors like Adi Shamir, Shafi Goldwasser, and Kalai.\nThe panel explored topics such as algorithmic bias, dual-use AI technologies, privacy-preserving AI, and the responsibilities of researchers in educating the public and policymakers. These discussions offered profound insights into the complexities of conducting ethical research in a rapidly evolving technological landscape, reminding me of the broader purpose of scientific innovation: to create a more equitable future.\nEthics of Scientific Research in the Age of AI Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing scientific research, offering transformative tools to accelerate discovery, enhance accuracy, and expand the boundaries of human knowledge. However, these advancements also bring profound ethical challenges. At the recent panel moderated by Prof. Simon Chesterman from the National University of Singapore, renowned experts Prof. Joan Rose (2016 Stockholm Water Prize), Prof. Yael Kalai (2022 ACM Prize in Computing), and Prof. Adi Shamir (2002 Turing Award) delved into the critical ethical considerations of AI in scientific research.\nClient Concerns About AI Ethical Dialogues AI systems increasingly shape scientific discovery, yet their application necessitates robust ethical guidelines. Governance frameworks must:\nDefine clear boundaries for AI use. Address biases inherent in data and algorithms. Ensure transparency and accountability in AI-driven research outcomes. Human Interaction The integration of AI into research workflows often alters the dynamic between human researchers and technology. Key considerations include:\nPreventing over-reliance on AI outputs, which could lead to critical oversights. Mitigating risks of misinterpretation of AI-generated results. Balancing human intuition with machine precision. Opportunities and Risks Power of AI AI holds immense potential to transform scientific methodologies:\n$$ \\text{Efficiency Gain} = \\frac{T_{\\text{manual}}}{T_{\\text{AI-assisted}}} $$\nWhere $T_{\\text{manual}}$ represents the time for traditional methods and $T_{\\text{AI-assisted}}$ denotes AI-accelerated approaches. While this formula underscores AI’s ability to enhance efficiency, ethical concerns include:\nMisinformation propagation due to AI biases. Job displacement for researchers whose roles are increasingly automated. Military Applications AI’s role in military research raises acute ethical dilemmas, particularly in autonomous weapons systems.

Introduction to LLMs for Satellite Images Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) like SatGPT for satellite imagery involves several critical stages. This process transforms a pre-trained model into a specialized tool capable of analyzing and generating insights from satellite images. This blog post provides a step-by-step guide to fine-tuning and deploying SatGPT, covering each phase in detail.\nIn their 2024 paper, “Good at Captioning, Bad at Counting: Benchmarking GPT-4V on Earth Observation Data” (arXiv:2401.17600), Zhang and Wang focus on developing a benchmark for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) applied to Earth Observation (EO) data. Their initial framework addresses three main areas: scene understanding, localization and counting, and change detection. To assess VLM performance across these areas, they design evaluations that span various applications, from wildlife conservation to urban monitoring, as illustrated in Figure 1. Their goals are to evaluate existing VLMs, provide insights into effective prompting techniques for EO tasks, and establish a flexible system for ongoing benchmark updates and future VLM evaluations.\nThe paper highlights several challenges and areas for future work. One major challenge is detecting data contamination, which is crucial for maintaining the fairness and effectiveness of benchmarks as VLMs evolve. Additionally, a more detailed analysis of model failures—such as knowledge gaps, reasoning errors, perceptual mistakes, and text misunderstandings—could provide deeper insights into current VLM capabilities. Zhang and Wang also note the static nature of benchmarks as a limitation, suggesting that dynamic updates may be necessary to keep benchmarks relevant and challenging as VLMs advance. #SatGPT is an app that lets you talk to satellite imagery.\nWe\u0026#39;ve got some more work to do before it\u0026#39;s polished, but I\u0026#39;m pretty psyched about the results so far.

Here are examples of inputs and outputs from various benchmark tasks and how five different VLMs stack up. They’ve included just a snippet of the user prompts and model responses to highlight the key points. [Good at captioning, bad at counting]\nExploring Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to Understand High-Level Features in Remotely Sensed Images In my recent work, I\u0026rsquo;ve been diving deep into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to see how well they perform in tasks that require understanding both visual and textual data. With the explosion of AI models that can interpret images and generate coherent, detailed text, it’s become increasingly important to assess these models not just on general benchmarks, but in specific, high-stakes domains like remotely sensed imagery.\nRemotely sensed images, which are collected from satellite or aerial platforms, provide a unique challenge for VLMs. They are dense with data, full of patterns, and often contain complex interactions between natural and man-made objects. The ability of a model to not only caption these images but also understand high-level features—such as differentiating between natural landmarks, infrastructure, and potential environmental changes—can have far-reaching applications in fields like agriculture, urban planning, and disaster response.\nFig. 2. A comparison of inputs and outputs from benchmark tasks using different VLMs. The snippet includes user prompts and model responses, highlighting key areas of model performance. [Good at captioning, bad at counting]\nWhat Makes Vision-Language Models (VLMs) Special? VLMs operate at the intersection of vision and language, giving them the ability to describe images with textual explanations. This makes them incredibly useful for analyzing and interpreting remote sensing data. In these images, VLMs can recognize patterns, identify important landmarks, and even offer insights into the features present within the scene.\nHowever, while these models excel at captioning tasks—offering detailed and sometimes creative descriptions—they can struggle with more precise tasks like counting objects or recognizing certain functional categories. This is a critical gap that must be addressed, especially in applications where accuracy is paramount.\nChallenges in Remote Sensing with VLMs One of the major challenges I’ve observed while working with VLMs on remotely sensed images is the models\u0026rsquo; difficulty in consistently recognizing high-level features, especially when dealing with complex or less common landmarks. This can lead to a high rate of refusal or incorrect identification in certain categories.\nFor instance, a model might easily recognize a natural park or large urban feature, but struggle to identify a specific sports venue or government building. These variances are especially pronounced when analyzing remote imagery, where the perspective and scale can make recognition even more difficult.\nBenchmarking VLMs on Landmark Recognition I ran some experiments using five different VLMs (GPT-4V, InstructBLIP-TS-XXL, InstructBLIP-Vicuna-13b, LLaVA-v1.5, Qwen-VL-Chat) to see how well they could identify landmarks in a set of remotely sensed images. Below is the summary of the results for landmark recognition accuracy (Table 1) and refusal rate (Table 2).\nTable 1: Landmark recognition accuracy by functional category and Table 2: Landmark recognition refusal rate. [Good at captioning, bad at counting]\nAs you can see, there are significant variances in how different models perform across these categories. GPT-4V and InstructBLIP tend to outperform other models in recognizing large, prominent landmarks like natural parks and urban infrastructure. However, there’s still considerable room for improvement, especially when identifying more specific or niche features, like places of worship or government buildings.\nDiving Deeper into VLMs: Case Studies of Landmark Recognition and Scene Interpretation The nuances of how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) understand and interpret images can be observed more clearly in specific examples. Below, I’ve analyzed a few key scenarios where GPT-4V has demonstrated both its strengths and limitations.\nVisual Recognition with Architectural Context One fascinating case is GPT-4V’s ability to link visual cues with its knowledge of architecture. In Figure 3, the model successfully identifies a landmark by connecting the architectural style with its vast knowledge base, arriving at the correct answer. This demonstrates its ability to use contextual clues beyond just object recognition.\nFig. 3. GPT-4V successfully corresponds visual cues with its knowledge about the architectural style of the landmark to arrive at the correct answer. [Good at captioning, bad at counting]\nThe Problem of Visual Misinterpretation However, VLMs aren\u0026rsquo;t infallible. One case where GPT-4V struggled is in the identification of the Nebraska State Capitol. In Figure 4, the model incorrectly eliminates the correct answer due to misidentifying the tower-like structure. This reveals a significant gap in its ability to distinguish more subtle architectural details, leading to incorrect conclusions.\nFig. 4. GPT-4V fails to identify the tower-like structure of the Nebraska State Capitol, leading to incorrect elimination. [Good at captioning, bad at counting]\nCorrect Identification but Weak Justifications Interestingly, even when GPT-4V identifies a landmark correctly, it sometimes provides insufficient reasoning. In Figure 5, the model identifies the landmark, but the reasoning lacks depth, which could be a hindrance in scenarios requiring detailed explanations, such as educational or research-oriented applications.\nFig. 5. GPT-4V correctly identifies the landmark but gives insufficient reasoning. [Good at captioning, bad at counting]\nGenerating Image Captions for Complex Scenes Another interesting scenario is when the model is tasked with generating captions for complex images. In Figure 6, GPT-4V generates several captions for an airport image. While the captions are coherent, they sometimes miss finer details, like the specific types of airplanes or terminal features, which could be crucial in more technical applications like surveillance or logistics planning.\nFig. 6. Example captions generated for an airport image. [Good at captioning, bad at counting]\nObject Localization in Remote Sensing Object localization is another key area where VLMs need to perform exceptionally well. In Figure 7, GPT-4V is tasked with localizing objects in a DIOR-RSVG dataset image. While it performs reasonably well, there are still challenges in precisely identifying and categorizing certain objects, especially in cluttered or low-contrast scenes.\nFig. 7. Example prompt and response for DIOR-RSVG object localization. [Good at captioning, bad at counting]\nDetecting Changes in xView2 Imagery Finally, in Figure 8, the model is put to the test with change detection using the xView2 dataset, where it must identify changes in infrastructure and the environment. This kind of task is essential in applications like disaster response or urban monitoring, where rapid and accurate assessments can make a significant difference. GPT-4V’s performance is promising, but it still leaves room for improvement, especially in recognizing more subtle changes or those happening over time.\nFig. 8. Example prompt and response for xView2 change detection. [Good at captioning, bad at counting]\nOverview of the Fine-Tuning Process The process of fine-tuning and deploying a satellite-specific LLM model involves the following stages:\nData Preparation Model Selection Fine-Tuning Paradigm Model Validation and Evaluation Export and Deployment to Hugging Face Step-by-Step Fine-Tuning of SatGPT for Satellite Imagery 1.

Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs) in Remote Sensing Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced models designed to understand and generate human-like text. They can be adapted for analyzing satellite imagery by combining multimodal inputs, like images and textual descriptions.\nKey Equations The underlying architecture for LLMs is based on the Transformer model, which is governed by: $[ \\mathbf{Z} = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{QK}^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)\\mathbf{V} ]$ where $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ are query, key, and value matrices respectively.\n2. Foundation Models and Their Role in LLMs Foundation models are pre-trained on extensive datasets and serve as the base for fine-tuning on specific tasks, such as satellite image analysis.\nKey Equations The objective during pre-training is to minimize: $[ MLM = - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\log P(x_i | x_{-i}; \\theta) ]$ where ${MLM}$ is the masked language modeling loss.\n3. Training vs Fine-tuning vs Pre-trained Models in LLMs Pre-trained Models: Trained on large-scale datasets. Fine-tuning: Adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task or dataset. Training: Training a model from scratch using a domain-specific dataset. Key Equations Cross-entropy loss function used during fine-tuning: $[ \\mathcal{L} = - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i) ]$\n4. How to Train LLMs on Satellite Images Training LLMs on satellite images involves using multimodal inputs and embeddings to represent both images and textual descriptions.\n5.

Using LangChain for Satellite Image LLM Applications LangChain facilitates chaining LLMs together for various tasks, such as preprocessing, analysis, and post-processing of satellite images.\nExample Using LangChain to preprocess satellite metadata:\nfrom langchain import SimplePromptTemplate template = SimplePromptTemplate(prompt=\u0026quot;Summarize satellite data: {data}\u0026quot;) summary = template.run(data=satellite_metadata) 7. Sample Datasets for LLM Fine-Tuning in Remote Sensing Datasets such as UC Merced Land Use, EuroSAT, and BigEarthNet are used for fine-tuning LLMs to handle specific satellite image tasks.\n8. Mathematical Foundations of Attention Mechanisms in LLMs The attention mechanism in LLMs is crucial for focusing on specific parts of the input data, such as regions in a satellite image.\nKey Equations Self-attention mechanism: $[ \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V ]$\n9. Multimodal LLM Architectures for Satellite Images Multimodal LLMs integrate both text and image data, allowing for comprehensive analysis of satellite imagery.\nKey Equations For multimodal learning, image and text representations are combined: $[ \\mathbf{Z} = \\text{Concat}(Z_{\\text{img}}, Z_{\\text{text}}) ]$\n10. Preprocessing Techniques for Satellite Images in LLMs Preprocessing techniques like normalization and histogram equalization are essential for preparing satellite images for analysis.\nKey Formulas Image normalization: $[ X\u0026rsquo; = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} ]$ where $X$ is the pixel value, $\\mu$ is the mean, and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation.\n11. Handling Illumination and Atmospheric Effects in LLMs Illumination and atmospheric distortions can affect satellite images, and models must be trained to handle these variations.\nKey Equations Illumination adjustment formula: $[ I\u0026rsquo; = \\frac{I}{\\cos(\\theta) + \\epsilon} ]$ where $\\theta$ is the solar zenith angle.\n12. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Satellite Image Analysis SSL techniques allow models to learn from unlabelled satellite data by setting up proxy tasks such as predicting missing data.\n13. Open-Source Tools for LLMs in Satellite Image Analysis Useful tools include Hugging Face Transformers for fine-tuning, LangChain for chaining models, and FastAI for data augmentation.\nExample Code Using Hugging Face Transformers:\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\u0026quot;bert-base-uncased\u0026quot;) model = BertModel.from_pretrained(\u0026quot;bert-base-uncased\u0026quot;) 14.

Freeze initial layers and fine-tune top layers. Train with domain-specific data. 15. Evaluation Metrics for LLMs in Remote Sensing Evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in remote sensing involves several metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, mean Average Precision (mAP), and BLEU score. These metrics help assess the quality of predictions and the relevance of generated content.\nKey Metrics Precision and Recall:\nPrecision measures the proportion of true positive results among all positive results predicted by the model. Recall measures the proportion of true positive results among all actual positive results. Key Equations Precision: $[ \\text{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} ]$ Recall: $[ \\text{Recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} ]$ where $TP$ is true positives, $FP$ is false positives, and $FN$ is false negatives.\nF1 Score:\nF1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. Key Equation $[ \\text{F1} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\cdot \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}} ]$\nmean Average Precision (mAP):\nmAP evaluates the precision of object detection models, averaging the precision across different recall levels. Key Equation Average Precision (AP) for a single class: $[ \\text{AP} = \\int_{0}^{1} \\text{Precision}(r) , \\text{Recall}(r) ]$ where $\\text{Precision}(r)$ is the precision at recall level $r$.\nmAP is the mean of AP across all classes: $[ \\text{mAP} = \\frac{1}{C} \\sum_{i=1}^{C} \\text{AP}_i ]$ where $C$ is the number of classes.\nBLEU Score:\nBLEU Score evaluates the quality of generated text by comparing it to reference texts, commonly used for tasks like image captioning. Key Equation BLEU score is calculated using n-gram precision: $[ \\text{BLEU} = \\text{exp}\\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n \\cdot \\log P_n\\right) ]$ where $P_n$ is the precision of n-grams, and $w_n$ is the weight for n-grams of length $n$.\nExample Code from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score from sklearn.metrics import average_precision_score, precision_recall_curve from nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu # Example for precision, recall, F1 score y_true = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0] y_pred = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1] precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred) recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred) f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred) # Example for BLEU score reference = [['GISTDA', 'is', 'the', 'premier', 'place', 'to', 'work', 'in', 'the', 'geo', 'sector', 'in', 'thailand']] candidate = ['GISTDA', 'is', 'the', 'best', 'workplace', 'in', 'geo', 'in', 'thailand'] bleu_score = sentence_bleu(reference, candidate) print(f\u0026quot;Precision: {precision}\u0026quot;) print(f\u0026quot;Recall: {recall}\u0026quot;) print(f\u0026quot;F1 Score: {f1}\u0026quot;) print(f\u0026quot;BLEU Score: {bleu_score}\u0026quot;) 16. Transfer Learning for Satellite Imagery Transfer learning uses models pre-trained on general datasets and adapts them for satellite image tasks through domain-specific fine-tuning.\nExample Code Using pre-trained ResNet for satellite image classification:\nfrom torchvision import models resnet = models.resnet50(pretrained=True) # Freeze general layers for param in resnet.parameters(): param.requires_grad = False # Fine-tune top layers resnet.fc = nn.Linear(in_features=2048, out_features=num_classes) 17. Explainability in LLMs for Remote Sensing (XAI) Explainable AI (XAI) methods enhance the transparency of LLM predictions, allowing users to understand how models make decisions based on satellite imagery.\nKey Techniques Attention Visualization: Shows which parts of the input data are focused on by the model. Grad-CAM: Generates heatmaps highlighting important regions in the satellite images. SHAP: Explains individual predictions by computing feature contributions. Key Equations Grad-CAM heatmap formula: $[ \\text{Grad-CAM}(A^k) = \\text{ReLU}\\left( \\sum_k \\alpha_k A^k \\right) ]$ where $\\alpha_k$ is the gradient of the loss with respect to the feature map $A^k$.\nExample Code Using Grad-CAM for explainability:\nimport torch import cv2 import numpy as np # Compute gradients def grad_cam(model, img): gradients = torch.autograd.grad(outputs=model(img), inputs=model.layer4) weights = torch.mean(gradients[0], dim=[2, 3], keepdim=True) cam = torch.sum(weights * model.layer4(img), dim=1) return cam # Apply Grad-CAM on an image cam_output = grad_cam(resnet, satellite_image) Conclusion In conclusion, large language models (LLMs) are making impressive strides in the realm of satellite data analysis, showcasing their potential across scene understanding, localization, counting, and change detection. These models are beginning to transform how we interpret complex satellite imagery, offering valuable insights for everything from environmental monitoring to urban development.\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain. Current benchmarks reveal that while LLMs excel in tasks like generating descriptive captions and recognizing landmarks, they sometimes fall short in areas requiring detailed object counting and nuanced change detection. This highlights the need for more refined evaluation methods to fully capture and enhance LLM capabilities.\nAs both satellite technology and LLMs continue to evolve, the path forward promises exciting developments. By refining benchmarks and exploring new methodologies, we can unlock even greater potential in this technology.\nI hope you enjoyed this deep dive into the intersection of LLMs and satellite data.

Introduction We are pleased to announce that our paper, titled Enhanced REG-Based Object Detection of Road Assets Utilizing Generalized Focal Loss: A Case Study on Thai Highway Imagery, has been accepted for oral presentation at the 5th International Conference on Highway Engineering (iCHE 2024). This opportunity marks a significant moment in our academic journey, especially after a hiatus from international conferences since completing my Ph.D. I am eager to re-engage with the academic community and share our recent advancements in person.\nMeet REG: The Game-Changer in Highway Asset Detection Hi guys, fellow tech enthusiasts! I\u0026rsquo;m thrilled to unveil a cutting-edge innovation from my latest research—Refined Generalized Focal Loss (REG). This revolutionary approach is transforming road asset detection on Thai highways, and it’s as exciting as it sounds.\nSo, what’s the big deal with REG? Imagine a detection system that not only sees but truly understands the intricate details of highway scenes. REG pushes the boundaries of current vision-based detection models by tackling the most challenging issues: imbalanced datasets, tiny objects, and complex highway backdrops.\nOur paper on “Refined Generalized Focal Loss for Road Asset Detection on Thai Highways” has been accepted for oral presentation at iCHE 2024!\n.\nExcited to share how we’re tackling road asset detection.\n.\n📖👀 Check out the details here: https://t.co/KTSGHITU7F\n.#iCHE2024 #AI\n\u0026mdash; Kao Panboonyuen (@kaopanboonyuen) September 7, 2024 My work (check out Fig. 1) brings a whole new level of precision to the table. By integrating a custom loss function into the detection architecture, REG doesn\u0026rsquo;t just improve performance—it redefines it. This means sharper, more reliable detection of critical road assets like signs, lane markings, and barriers. And let’s be real, that’s a game-changer for infrastructure management and road safety.\nFig. 1. The REG-based detection framework employs Generalized Focal Loss to master class imbalance in Thai highway road asset detection. Combining Transformer layers with convolutional modules, and using Batch Normalization and Adaptive Dropout, this model stands out for its robustness. It’s finely tuned to capture the unique aspects of Thai highways, focusing on rare and challenging assets. [Refined Generalized Focal Loss]\nREG isn\u0026rsquo;t just a theoretical leap; it’s a practical breakthrough with real-world impact. It’s especially useful for regions with road structures similar to Thai highways, where conventional detection algorithms might falter. By merging Vision Transformers (ViT) with conditional random fields (CRF), we’ve supercharged the model’s ability to segment and identify road assets with pinpoint accuracy.\nThis isn’t just about the future of intelligent transportation systems; it’s about the here and now. As we edge closer to autonomous vehicle navigation, innovations like REG are paving the way for smarter, safer roads. Buckle up and stay tuned—exciting times are ahead! Motivation and Relevance Thailand\u0026rsquo;s highway infrastructure plays a critical role in its economic development and connectivity. However, managing and maintaining these extensive road networks presents numerous challenges, particularly in detecting and assessing road assets. Accurate identification of road features such as signs, barriers, and markings is essential for effective maintenance and safety management.\nIn this context, our research addresses a pressing need in highway engineering: improving road asset detection on Thai highways. Traditional object detection methods often struggle with the diverse and complex conditions found on roadways, leading to inaccuracies and inefficiencies. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a novel approach that leverages an advanced vision model with a refined Generalized Focal Loss. Our proposed method (Fig. 2) enhances the capability of REG-based object detection systems by incorporating a tailored loss function designed to address the unique characteristics of Thai highway imagery. By optimizing the detection process, our approach aims to provide more reliable and precise data for road asset management. This advancement not only contributes to the field of highway engineering but also supports the development of more efficient infrastructure management practices in Thailand.\nFig. 2. The proposed Enhanced REG-based object detection framework integrates Generalized Focal Loss for improved detection accuracy. This approach includes various REG model variants, ranging from REGn to REGx, each offering a balance between computational efficiency and detection performance. The network architecture leverages convolutional layers with Batch Normalization and Leaky ReLU activations. The Generalized Focal Loss, designed to address class imbalance, enhances performance for small and difficult-to-detect objects by focusing on hard examples. Our contribution didn’t just stop at the models; we also built our own dataset from scratch. By equipping a vehicle with high-resolution cameras, we captured detailed imagery of road assets across Thai highways. This custom dataset forms the backbone of our approach, providing a strong foundation for model training. The training utilizes the AdamW optimizer with specific hyperparameters to optimize convergence and model performance. [REG: Refined Generalized Focal Loss]\nThis paper represents a significant step forward in applying cutting-edge computer vision techniques to real-world problems. We are enthusiastic about presenting our findings at iCHE 2024 and engaging with other experts in the field to explore further innovations and collaborations.\nStay tuned for updates, and a big thank you to my incredible research team:\nN. Rattanachona (N\u0026rsquo;Fuse), P. Thungthin (N\u0026rsquo;Dear), N. Subsompon (N\u0026rsquo;Tien). Your hard work and dedication were essential to this project!\nHere I am, presenting our work on the Enhanced REG model and its application in detecting road assets!\nWe have visualizations of the detection results produced by the Enhanced REG model. The bounding boxes and labels demonstrate the model’s ability to accurately locate and classify objects. These visuals reflect the high-resolution output and the model’s performance in detecting road assets in various environments. The clarity of these results illustrates the practical utility of our model in real-time applications. It effectively showcases how our model handles complex and dynamic scenes.\nGeneralized Focal Loss for Multi-Class Detection The detection task focuses on identifying seven key classes of road assets: Pavilions, Pedestrian bridges, Information signs, Single-arm poles, Bus stops, Warning signs, and Concrete guardrails (Fig. 3). The challenge lies in dealing with class imbalance — smaller and harder-to-detect objects can be easily overlooked by traditional object detection models. We address this by utilizing Generalized Focal Loss (GFL), which extends the classical Focal Loss to multi-class detection, giving more focus to underrepresented and challenging classes.\nFig. 3. My proposed Generalized Focal Loss for multi-class detection tackles class imbalance across seven asset classes. By extending Focal Loss, we improve detection accuracy for small and difficult-to-classify objects.\nRefined Generalized Focal Loss for Segmentation For the segmentation task, we detect road assets at the pixel level, focusing on five classes: Pavilions, Pedestrian bridges, Information signs, Warning signs, and Concrete guardrails (Fig. 4). The key here is to ensure that every pixel is correctly classified into one of these categories, which is a non-trivial problem in cluttered highway imagery. My Refined Generalized Focal Loss applies pixel-wise loss calculation, extending GFL into the realm of segmentation.\nFig. 4. The segmentation process classifies each pixel into one of five road asset classes, using Refined Generalized Focal Loss to enhance pixel-wise accuracy in segmentation tasks.\nNow, let’s look at a real-world application of our Enhanced REG model in detecting road assets. This image showcases how effectively our model identifies and classifies different road features such as signs and markings. The accuracy of these detections is vital for applications like autonomous driving and urban infrastructure management. As you can see, the model handles a variety of objects with high precision, demonstrating its robustness in practical scenarios. This performance underscores the model\u0026rsquo;s potential for real-world deployment.\nThis chart presents a comparison of performance metrics between our Enhanced REG model and previous versions. We observe significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score. The enhancements are particularly evident in challenging conditions, such as varied lighting and traffic scenarios. These metrics highlight the effectiveness of our model\u0026rsquo;s enhancements. By achieving superior results, our approach sets a new benchmark in object detection accuracy.\nFinally, this image illustrates the training process for the Enhanced REG model. It depicts the stages of optimization and fine-tuning, with various datasets and augmentation techniques used to enhance the model’s performance. The iterative process shown here is crucial for achieving the high accuracy demonstrated in our results. Observing these training phases provides insights into how we refined the model. This rigorous approach is key to ensuring the model’s effectiveness and reliability in practical applications.\nRefinement Term for Spatial-Contextual Learning To further enhance learning, we introduce a spatial-contextual refinement term $(g_{i,c})$ that dynamically adjusts the loss based on the geometric and contextual significance of each object class (Fig. 5). This term allows the model to account for the spatial distribution of road assets, making it more adept at handling complex scenes typical of real-world road environments.\nFig. 5. The refinement term \\(g_{i,c}\\) adjusts the loss based on spatial and contextual relevance, improving model learning in complex and cluttered road scenes.\nJoint Optimization for Detection and Segmentation We then integrate the detection and segmentation tasks into a joint optimization framework. By combining the losses for both tasks (Fig. 6), the model learns complementary representations, allowing it to improve both object detection and pixel-wise segmentation accuracy. This joint approach ensures that the model balances precision and recall across different road asset classes.\nFig. 6. Joint optimization balances detection and segmentation losses, enhancing performance across both tasks by learning complementary features.\nIncorporating Prediction Uncertainty To further refine REG, we incorporated prediction uncertainty using a Gaussian distribution (Fig. 7). This technique accounts for the inherent noise and ambiguity in complex environments, particularly under varying lighting and cluttered backgrounds, thereby improving both robustness and accuracy.\nFig. 7. We model prediction uncertainty using a Gaussian distribution to handle noise and ambiguity, particularly in challenging road scenes.\nMathematical Foundations for Optimization in REG The optimization of REG is based on advanced techniques in stochastic optimization, where we extend traditional gradient descent to operate on Riemannian Manifolds (Fig. 8). Given the non-convex nature of the loss landscape, we utilize variational inference, proximal gradient methods, and Lagrangian multipliers, allowing for efficient optimization in multi-task learning.\nFig. 8. Advanced mathematical techniques, including Riemannian stochastic gradient descent, underpin the optimization of REG in complex, high-dimensional spaces.\nPerformance Analysis for Detection and Segmentation Finally, we tested the model\u0026rsquo;s performance on both detection (Fig. 9) and segmentation tasks (Fig. 10). REG demonstrated significant improvements in mAP50, F1-score, and other key metrics, showcasing its capability to handle both high-overlap detection and detailed mask segmentation.\nFig. 9. REG outperforms other models in detection tasks, especially in high-overlap scenarios, with superior mAP50 and F1 scores.\nFig. 10. The segmentation performance of REG shows exceptional accuracy in generating precise masks, particularly in challenging environments.\nthis work introduces Refined Generalized Focal Loss (REG), which significantly improves the detection and segmentation of road assets in complex environments. By applying advanced mathematical techniques and integrating spatial-contextual learning, REG addresses the challenges of class imbalance and localization in highway asset detection. The mathematical insights behind this model, including optimization on Riemannian manifolds and probabilistic refinement, provide a robust framework for future improvements in vision-based infrastructure management systems.\nFor those interested in exploring the full mathematical derivation and code, please check out the REG: Refined Generalized Focal Loss on GitHub.\nRecap: A Journey Through Road Asset Detection and Segmentation on Thai Highways Understanding the Scene Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re driving along a bustling Thai highway, surrounded by a landscape dotted with various road assets. These assets include everything from pavilions providing shade and rest areas, pedestrian bridges allowing safe crossing, and information signs guiding motorists, to single-arm poles supporting traffic signals, bus stops, warning signs alerting drivers of upcoming hazards, and concrete guardrails safeguarding the road\u0026rsquo;s edge. Each of these elements plays a critical role in ensuring the safety and efficiency of the highway system.\nThe Challenge: Detection and Segmentation To manage and maintain these assets effectively, automated systems are employed to detect and segment these features from images captured along the highway. This process involves two main tasks: detection and segmentation.\nDetection Tasks:\nIn detection, the goal is to identify and locate these assets within images. For the Thai highways, there are seven specific classes of road assets to detect:\nPavilions: Structures offering shade and rest for travelers. Pedestrian Bridges: Elevated walkways ensuring safe crossing over the highway. Information Signs: Signs providing crucial information to drivers. Single-Arm Poles: Posts supporting traffic signals or cameras. Bus Stops: Designated areas where buses pick up and drop off passengers. Warning Signs: Signs alerting drivers to potential hazards ahead. Concrete Guardrails: Barriers designed to prevent vehicles from veering off the road. Segmentation Tasks:\nSegmentation takes this a step further by assigning a specific class label to each pixel in the image, providing a detailed map of where each type of asset is located. For the Thai highways, the segmentation focuses on five classes:\nPavilions: Highlighted as areas of rest and shelter. Pedestrian Bridges: Marked to show their location and coverage. Information Signs: Detailed to ensure visibility and accessibility. Warning Signs: Identified to enhance hazard awareness. Concrete Guardrails: Outlined to confirm their placement along the road. The Process in Action 1. Detection:\nPicture an advanced AI system analyzing highway images. It scans each image to detect the seven classes of road assets. Using bounding boxes, the system outlines each asset\u0026rsquo;s location, distinguishing between the pavilions providing shade and the concrete guardrails ensuring safety. This detection process helps in cataloging and managing each asset efficiently.\n2. Segmentation:\nMoving to segmentation, the AI system processes the same images to create a detailed pixel-level map. Each pixel in the image is classified into one of the five categories, such as pavilions, pedestrian bridges, and warning signs. This precise classification allows for a thorough understanding of where each asset is situated, helping with tasks like maintenance scheduling and safety assessments.\nReal-World Impact This dual approach—detection and segmentation—ensures that every asset along the Thai highways is accurately identified and mapped. For instance, knowing the exact location of warning signs can help in assessing their visibility and effectiveness. Similarly, detailed segmentation of concrete guardrails aids in monitoring their condition and integrity.\nPaper Highlights: Our research addresses a critical issue in road safety: detecting key road assets such as pedestrian bridges, pavilions, signs, and concrete guardrails. We implemented an enhanced REG model integrated with Generalized Focal Loss, which significantly improves detection accuracy, especially in complex environments with diverse lighting and backgrounds.\nComprehensive Analysis of Generalized Focal Loss and Last Layer Architectures In computer vision, both object detection and semantic segmentation are crucial tasks that leverage different approaches and final layer architectures in deep learning models. This document provides an in-depth technical overview of Generalized Focal Loss applied to both tasks, and a detailed comparison of the final layers used in each.\nGeneralized Focal Loss for Vision Tasks Generalized Focal Loss (GFL) is designed to address class imbalance and focus learning on hard-to-detect objects by adjusting the standard focal loss. This approach is applicable to both detection and segmentation tasks but is formulated slightly differently for each.\nObjective: In object detection, GFL helps to improve the accuracy of detecting objects and managing class imbalance by focusing on harder-to-detect objects.\nMathematical Formula:\nFor detection tasks involving multiple classes (e.g., Pavilions, Pedestrian Bridges, etc.), the Generalized Focal Loss is given by:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{GFL}}^{\\text{Detection}} = - \\alpha \\left(1 - p_t\\right)^\\gamma \\log(p_t) $$\nWhere:\n$p_t$ represents the predicted probability for the correct class. $\\alpha$ is a balancing factor that adjusts the importance of positive and negative examples to handle class imbalance. $\\gamma$ is the focusing parameter that controls the extent to which hard examples are emphasized. Higher values of $\\gamma$ increase the focus on difficult examples. For detecting objects like Pedestrian Bridges or Concrete Guardrails, which may appear in challenging conditions, GFL reduces the weight of easy examples and enhances the learning from complex cases, such as those with partial occlusions or poor lighting. Explaining the Two Samples: Detection and Segmentation For detection, consider a scenario where we need to locate a Pavilion on a highway. The Generalized Focal Loss helps reduce the loss contribution from easily detected Pavilions—those that are in clear view—and shifts the model\u0026rsquo;s focus to harder cases, like Pavilions that may be partially obscured by other objects or in poor lighting. By emphasizing these challenging examples, the model improves its overall performance on diverse highway scenes.\nFor segmentation, imagine the task of segmenting an Information Sign pixel by pixel. Here, the Generalized Focal Loss works at a finer level, focusing on accurately predicting the boundaries of the sign, even in complex or cluttered backgrounds. The model learns to pay more attention to pixels where it’s less confident, which results in sharper and more accurate segmentation outcomes.\nThis dual application of the Generalized Focal Loss—both for bounding box detection and for pixel-level segmentation—enables our model to excel in both tasks, effectively handling the complexities of road asset management in real-world highway conditions.\nIn the images, we’re showcasing a progression of deep learning techniques. Starting with (a) as the original input and (b) as the expected target output, we then move through different versions of REG—(c) REGn, (d) REGs, (e) REGm, (f) REGl, and (g) REGx. Now, the key point to note is that (f) and (g) highlight our proposed enhancement, where we’ve integrated a refined Generalized Focal Loss into YOLO. What’s impressive here is that you’ll see it clearly outperforms the other methods, especially in both detection (bounding boxes) and segmentation (pixel-based).\nThe first image focuses on detection, showing the bounding box results. Meanwhile, the second image dives deeper into instance segmentation, illustrating pixel-level accuracy.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s break it down. In the first image, you\u0026rsquo;ll see how each version of REG handles object detection by drawing bounding boxes around the identified objects. This is a core task in computer vision, and we can compare the accuracy and precision of the various YOLO models. With our enhanced method using the refined Generalized Focal Loss, which we\u0026rsquo;ve integrated into REGl and REGx, you’ll notice a significant improvement in the clarity and correctness of the bounding boxes. These results indicate that our approach performs better at accurately locating objects in the images.\nNext, in the second image, the focus shifts to instance segmentation, where instead of just detecting objects with boxes, we’re identifying the exact pixel regions for each object. This is a more complex task that requires higher precision. Here again, our enhanced REG models stand out. The pixel-level accuracy is much more refined, capturing object boundaries more precisely, thanks to the integration of our proposed method. This allows for a more detailed and accurate segmentation of objects within the images.\nTo summarize, our proposed enhancements to the REG model—through the integration of refined Generalized Focal Loss—deliver significant improvements in both object detection and instance segmentation. The results across both images clearly demonstrate that our approach excels at accurately detecting and precisely segmenting objects. Whether it’s drawing clean bounding boxes or defining exact pixel regions, our method proves to be the clear winner. This shows that refining loss functions can have a big impact on model performance, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with deep learning in computer vision.\nFinal Insights: Pioneering Precision with REG in Highway Asset Detection 1. Introduction to Generalized Focal Loss In our paper, \u0026lsquo;Refined Generalized Focal Loss for Road Asset Detection on Thai Highways Using Vision-Based Detection and Segmentation Models\u0026rsquo;, we explore advancements in object detection and segmentation models tailored for detecting road assets on Thai highways. These assets include a variety of elements crucial for road safety and efficiency.\nGeneralized Focal Loss for Detection Tasks Generalized Focal Loss (GFL) is an enhancement over traditional focal loss, which aims to address class imbalance by focusing more on hard-to-detect objects. It introduces a dynamic focal weight that is adaptive to different classes, improving detection performance in complex scenarios.\nKey Equation for Detection The Generalized Focal Loss is formulated as: $[ \\text{GFL}_{\\text{det}} = - \\frac{1 - \\text{p}_i^{\\gamma}}{1 - \\text{p}_i} \\cdot \\text{log}(\\text{p}_i) ]$ where $\\text{p}_i$ is the predicted probability for the $i$-th class, and $\\gamma$ is the focusing parameter.\nGeneralized Focal Loss for Segmentation Tasks For segmentation tasks, GFL adapts by focusing on pixel-wise predictions, enhancing the model\u0026rsquo;s ability to handle imbalanced data and challenging regions within the images.\n2. Formula for Difference Between Detection and Segmentation Models The primary difference in the loss functions for detection and segmentation tasks is how they handle spatial versus class-level data. Detection models often deal with bounding boxes and class predictions, while segmentation models handle pixel-wise classification.\n3. Optimization in Object Detection and Segmentation Optimization in object detection and segmentation models involves tuning hyperparameters and adjusting learning rates to improve convergence and performance.\n4. Mathematical Formulas to Know Understanding the following formulas is crucial for implementing and refining GFL in detection and segmentation tasks:\nSoftmax Function: $[ \\text{softmax}(z_i) = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j} e^{z_j}} ]$ where $z_i$ is the score for class $i$.\nCross-Entropy Loss: $[ \\text{CrossEntropy}(y, \\hat{y}) = - \\sum_{i} y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i) ]$ where $y_i$ is the ground truth and $\\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted probability.\nDice Coefficient: $[ \\text{Dice} = \\frac{2 |A \\cap B|}{|A| + |B|} ]$ where $A$ and $B$ are the predicted and true segmentation masks.\nWhat’s Next? Our paper will undergo a fast-track formal review process for potential publication in the Transportmetrica A journal. We’re optimistic that this research will significantly contribute to highway engineering and road asset management fields.\nI’m genuinely excited to share our findings at iCHE 2024 and connect with the incredible minds in the field. I hope our research sparks inspiration in others, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. It would be truly rewarding if our work motivates even one person to contribute to something extraordinary in the world. Research is not just about discovering new things—it\u0026rsquo;s about igniting ideas, fostering collaboration, and collectively making a positive impact.

As an AI research scientist, your life revolves around decoding complex algorithms, fine-tuning models, and pushing the boundaries of what artificial intelligence can achieve. The journey typically involves diving into vast datasets, developing and experimenting with sophisticated neural networks, and translating theoretical concepts into practical, real-world applications. The thrill of seeing a new model perform exceptionally well or uncovering a novel insight drives the passion in this field. Collaboration with peers and staying abreast of the latest advancements is crucial, making continuous learning an integral part of the job.\nTransforming Research with Gemini and Modern LLMs\nThe landscape of AI research is undergoing a significant transformation with the advent of advanced large language models (LLMs) like Gemini. These cutting-edge tools are revolutionizing how researchers approach their work, enabling more efficient data processing and deeper insights. Gemini’s innovative architecture offers enhanced capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, which streamlines the development of sophisticated AI systems.

The answer lies in the different kinds of excitement each provides. In academia, I\u0026rsquo;m drawn to the elegance and complexity of theoretical work—understanding AI at its core and pushing its boundaries. On the other hand, the industrial side offers the thrill of seeing AI solutions deployed in real-world applications, making a tangible impact.\nI firmly believe that combining both worlds enriches my research. It\u0026rsquo;s incredibly fulfilling to publish groundbreaking work and even more exhilarating when that research translates into practical solutions that benefit society. This dual approach keeps me grounded in the realities of implementation while allowing me to explore theoretical possibilities. Key Qualities for Ideal AI Agents The ideal characteristics (Fig. 2) envisioned for AI agents are numerous, each presenting its own significant research challenge before even considering the automatic acquisition of these traits:\nLearning to learn: The ability to enhance its learning process over time [2]–[8]. Lifelong learning: Engaging in continual and incremental learning throughout its existence [9]–[13]. Gradual knowledge and skill accumulation: Building up knowledge and abilities progressively, layer by layer. Reuse of learned knowledge: Applying previously acquired skills to discover and learn new ones, incorporating both forward and backward knowledge transfer [10]. Open-ended exploration: The capability to explore without predefined boundaries [14], [15] and to set its own self-invented goals for learning [16]–[20]. Out-of-distribution generalization: Extending its learning capabilities to new and previously unseen problems [21]–[24] and making logical extrapolations beyond its initial training data [25], [26]. Fig. 1. TA Badger agent is trained with bi-level optimization, involving two loops: the outer loop, which focuses on lifelong learning and other requirements, and the inner loop, where the agent undergoes extensive training on various curricula to develop skills approaching human-level proficiency. Goodai-Research-Roadmap\nFig. 2. I had the chance to dive into \"Career Paths for AI Research Scientists: My Journey and Insights\" during a talk at Sirindhorn Science Home (SSH). It was a great opportunity to share my experiences and offer some tips on navigating the exciting world of AI research. Sirindhorn Science Home (SSH)\nThere are various strategies to develop agents with these properties. At GoodAI, they have converged on foundational principles such as the modularity of agents, a shared policy across modules with varying internal states, and a blend of meta-learning in the outer loop followed by open-ended learning in the inner loop. These principles are central to their Badger architectures and will be discussed further in the section \u0026ldquo;Towards Implementation.\u0026rdquo; It is essential to highlight that these desired properties should manifest during the agent\u0026rsquo;s operational phase, specifically in the inner loop (the agent’s lifetime). They often utilize a meta-learning approach, which involves a bi-level optimization process where optimization occurs at two levels [4], [27], [28]. This meta-learning framework is considered the default setting throughout this discussion unless otherwise noted.\nThe Cool Factor in Research One of the key motivators for any researcher is the \u0026ldquo;cool factor\u0026rdquo;—that sense of excitement when working on something groundbreaking. For me, that thrill comes from applying AI to satellite imagery for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) analysis in agriculture. The very idea of using AI to derive insights from images captured from space is inherently fascinating.\nImagine using AI to assist in medical diagnostics. For instance, developing an AI model that can detect polyps or tumors during a colonoscopy more accurately than current state-of-the-art methods. Not only is this research cool, but it also has a profound impact—it can save lives. AI might not yet match human experts in every scenario, but as an early detection tool, its potential is undeniable. Understanding the Three Types of Artificial Intelligence For those pursuing a career as AI research scientists, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to understand the different categories of AI based on their capabilities:\nNarrow AI (Weak AI or ANI): Narrow AI is specialized in performing specific tasks. It is designed with a narrow focus and cannot operate outside its pre-defined capabilities. Research in this area involves developing and fine-tuning algorithms to perform specialized tasks efficiently, such as facial recognition, language translation, and recommendation systems. Career opportunities here include roles like AI specialist, data scientist, and machine learning engineer.\nGeneral AI (Strong AI or AGI): General AI aims to mirror human cognitive abilities, enabling it to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks. Working in this field requires a deep understanding of various AI and machine learning techniques, and researchers often focus on creating systems that can think and reason like humans. Careers in this area might involve research positions in advanced AI labs, academia, or tech companies that are pioneering AGI development.\nArtificial Superintelligence (ASI): ASI represents the pinnacle of AI development, where machines would surpass human intelligence across all domains. Research here is still theoretical but involves exploring concepts that could eventually lead to machines with superior cognitive abilities. Professionals focusing on ASI are usually involved in speculative research, ethical considerations, and futuristic technology development. Career paths might include roles as AI ethicists, theoretical AI researchers, or innovators at cutting-edge research institutions.\nUnderstanding these AI types (Fig. 2) can guide aspiring AI researchers in choosing the right focus area for their careers, whether it\u0026rsquo;s enhancing specialized AI applications or contributing to the quest for creating truly intelligent machines.\nFig. 2.

As an AI research scientist, your life revolves around decoding complex algorithms, fine-tuning models, and pushing the boundaries of what artificial intelligence can achieve. The journey typically involves diving into vast datasets, developing and experimenting with sophisticated neural networks, and translating theoretical concepts into practical, real-world applications. The thrill of seeing a new model perform exceptionally well or uncovering a novel insight drives the passion in this field. Collaboration with peers and staying abreast of the latest advancements is crucial, making continuous learning an integral part of the job.\nTransforming Research with Gemini and Modern LLMs\nThe landscape of AI research is undergoing a significant transformation with the advent of advanced large language models (LLMs) like Gemini. These cutting-edge tools are revolutionizing how researchers approach their work, enabling more efficient data processing and deeper insights. Gemini’s innovative architecture offers enhanced capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, which streamlines the development of sophisticated AI systems. By leveraging LLMs, researchers can automate complex tasks, accelerate experimentation, and uncover patterns that were previously challenging to detect. This paradigm shift not only boosts productivity but also opens new avenues for exploration, setting the stage for groundbreaking advancements in artificial intelligence.\nRight now, I’m diving deep as a Postdoctoral Fellow in AI research, a role I’ve embraced from the age of 27 to now, at 31. My journey involves crafting next-gen algorithms in Pattern Recognition, Optimization Theory, and Statistical Learning. At MARS, I’m on the front lines, applying AI to tackle real-world challenges, especially in the auto insurance sector.\nCurious to know more about my work and adventures? Check out my profile here: kaopanboonyuen.github.io.\nBalancing Academia and Industry Why do I juggle both academic and industrial roles? The answer lies in the different kinds of excitement each provides. In academia, I\u0026rsquo;m drawn to the elegance and complexity of theoretical work—understanding AI at its core and pushing its boundaries. On the other hand, the industrial side offers the thrill of seeing AI solutions deployed in real-world applications, making a tangible impact.\nI firmly believe that combining both worlds enriches my research. It\u0026rsquo;s incredibly fulfilling to publish groundbreaking work and even more exhilarating when that research translates into practical solutions that benefit society. This dual approach keeps me grounded in the realities of implementation while allowing me to explore theoretical possibilities. Key Qualities for Ideal AI Agents The ideal characteristics (Fig. 2) envisioned for AI agents are numerous, each presenting its own significant research challenge before even considering the automatic acquisition of these traits:\nLearning to learn: The ability to enhance its learning process over time [2]–[8]. Lifelong learning: Engaging in continual and incremental learning throughout its existence [9]–[13]. Gradual knowledge and skill accumulation: Building up knowledge and abilities progressively, layer by layer. Reuse of learned knowledge: Applying previously acquired skills to discover and learn new ones, incorporating both forward and backward knowledge transfer [10]. Open-ended exploration: The capability to explore without predefined boundaries [14], [15] and to set its own self-invented goals for learning [16]–[20]. Out-of-distribution generalization: Extending its learning capabilities to new and previously unseen problems [21]–[24] and making logical extrapolations beyond its initial training data [25], [26]. Fig. 1. TA Badger agent is trained with bi-level optimization, involving two loops: the outer loop, which focuses on lifelong learning and other requirements, and the inner loop, where the agent undergoes extensive training on various curricula to develop skills approaching human-level proficiency. Goodai-Research-Roadmap\nFig. 2. I had the chance to dive into \"Career Paths for AI Research Scientists: My Journey and Insights\" during a talk at Sirindhorn Science Home (SSH). It was a great opportunity to share my experiences and offer some tips on navigating the exciting world of AI research. Sirindhorn Science Home (SSH)\nThere are various strategies to develop agents with these properties. At GoodAI, they have converged on foundational principles such as the modularity of agents, a shared policy across modules with varying internal states, and a blend of meta-learning in the outer loop followed by open-ended learning in the inner loop. These principles are central to their Badger architectures and will be discussed further in the section \u0026ldquo;Towards Implementation.\u0026rdquo; It is essential to highlight that these desired properties should manifest during the agent\u0026rsquo;s operational phase, specifically in the inner loop (the agent’s lifetime). They often utilize a meta-learning approach, which involves a bi-level optimization process where optimization occurs at two levels [4], [27], [28]. This meta-learning framework is considered the default setting throughout this discussion unless otherwise noted.\nThe Cool Factor in Research One of the key motivators for any researcher is the \u0026ldquo;cool factor\u0026rdquo;—that sense of excitement when working on something groundbreaking. For me, that thrill comes from applying AI to satellite imagery for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) analysis in agriculture. The very idea of using AI to derive insights from images captured from space is inherently fascinating.\nImagine using AI to assist in medical diagnostics. For instance, developing an AI model that can detect polyps or tumors during a colonoscopy more accurately than current state-of-the-art methods. Not only is this research cool, but it also has a profound impact—it can save lives. AI might not yet match human experts in every scenario, but as an early detection tool, its potential is undeniable. Understanding the Three Types of Artificial Intelligence For those pursuing a career as AI research scientists, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to understand the different categories of AI based on their capabilities:\nNarrow AI (Weak AI or ANI): Narrow AI is specialized in performing specific tasks. It is designed with a narrow focus and cannot operate outside its pre-defined capabilities. Research in this area involves developing and fine-tuning algorithms to perform specialized tasks efficiently, such as facial recognition, language translation, and recommendation systems. Career opportunities here include roles like AI specialist, data scientist, and machine learning engineer.\nGeneral AI (Strong AI or AGI): General AI aims to mirror human cognitive abilities, enabling it to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks. Working in this field requires a deep understanding of various AI and machine learning techniques, and researchers often focus on creating systems that can think and reason like humans. Careers in this area might involve research positions in advanced AI labs, academia, or tech companies that are pioneering AGI development.\nArtificial Superintelligence (ASI): ASI represents the pinnacle of AI development, where machines would surpass human intelligence across all domains. Research here is still theoretical but involves exploring concepts that could eventually lead to machines with superior cognitive abilities. Professionals focusing on ASI are usually involved in speculative research, ethical considerations, and futuristic technology development. Career paths might include roles as AI ethicists, theoretical AI researchers, or innovators at cutting-edge research institutions.\nUnderstanding these AI types (Fig. 2) can guide aspiring AI researchers in choosing the right focus area for their careers, whether it\u0026rsquo;s enhancing specialized AI applications or contributing to the quest for creating truly intelligent machines.\nFig. 2.

After a long absence from international conferences since my Ph.D. studies, I\u0026rsquo;m incredibly excited to rejoin the academic community in person and present our latest research.\nDive into the complete details of our research on road asset detection in Thai highways with advanced vision models. Check out the full blog post here: REG: Refined Generalized Focal Loss for Road Asset Detection\nMeet REG: The Game-Changer in Highway Asset Detection Hi guys, fellow tech enthusiasts! I\u0026rsquo;m thrilled to unveil a cutting-edge innovation from my latest research—Refined Generalized Focal Loss (REG). This revolutionary approach is transforming road asset detection on Thai highways, and it’s as exciting as it sounds.\nSo, what’s the big deal with REG? Imagine a detection system that not only sees but truly understands the intricate details of highway scenes. REG pushes the boundaries of current vision-based detection models by tackling the most challenging issues: imbalanced datasets, tiny objects, and complex highway backdrops.\nMy method (check out Fig. 1) brings a whole new level of precision to the table. By integrating a custom loss function into the detection architecture, REG doesn\u0026rsquo;t just improve performance—it redefines it. This means sharper, more reliable detection of critical road assets like signs, lane markings, and barriers. And let’s be real, that’s a game-changer for infrastructure management and road safety.\nFig. 1. The REG-based detection framework employs Generalized Focal Loss to master class imbalance in Thai highway road asset detection. Combining Transformer layers with convolutional modules, and using Batch Normalization and Adaptive Dropout, this model stands out for its robustness. It’s finely tuned to capture the unique aspects of Thai highways, focusing on rare and challenging assets. [Refined Generalized Focal Loss]\nREG isn\u0026rsquo;t just a theoretical leap; it’s a practical breakthrough with real-world impact. It’s especially useful for regions with road structures similar to Thai highways, where conventional detection algorithms might falter. By merging Vision Transformers (ViT) with conditional random fields (CRF), we’ve supercharged the model’s ability to segment and identify road assets with pinpoint accuracy.\nThis isn’t just about the future of intelligent transportation systems; it’s about the here and now. As we edge closer to autonomous vehicle navigation, innovations like REG are paving the way for smarter, safer roads. Buckle up and stay tuned—exciting times are ahead! Motivation and Relevance Thailand\u0026rsquo;s highway infrastructure plays a critical role in its economic development and connectivity. However, managing and maintaining these extensive road networks presents numerous challenges, particularly in detecting and assessing road assets. Accurate identification of road features such as signs, barriers, and markings is essential for effective maintenance and safety management.\nIn this context, our research addresses a pressing need in highway engineering: improving road asset detection on Thai highways. Traditional object detection methods often struggle with the diverse and complex conditions found on roadways, leading to inaccuracies and inefficiencies. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a novel approach that leverages an advanced vision model with a refined Generalized Focal Loss. Our proposed method (Fig. 2) enhances the capability of REG-based object detection systems by incorporating a tailored loss function designed to address the unique characteristics of Thai highway imagery. By optimizing the detection process, our approach aims to provide more reliable and precise data for road asset management. This advancement not only contributes to the field of highway engineering but also supports the development of more efficient infrastructure management practices in Thailand.\nFig. 2. The proposed Enhanced REG-based object detection framework integrates Generalized Focal Loss for improved detection accuracy. This approach includes various REG model variants, ranging from REGn to REGx, each offering a balance between computational efficiency and detection performance. The network architecture leverages convolutional layers with Batch Normalization and Leaky ReLU activations. The Generalized Focal Loss, designed to address class imbalance, enhances performance for small and difficult-to-detect objects by focusing on hard examples. Our contribution didn’t just stop at the models; we also built our own dataset from scratch. By equipping a vehicle with high-resolution cameras, we captured detailed imagery of road assets across Thai highways. This custom dataset forms the backbone of our approach, providing a strong foundation for model training. The training utilizes the AdamW optimizer with specific hyperparameters to optimize convergence and model performance. [REG: Refined Generalized Focal Loss]\nThis paper represents a significant step forward in applying cutting-edge computer vision techniques to real-world problems. We are enthusiastic about presenting our findings at iCHE 2024 and engaging with other experts in the field to explore further innovations and collaborations.\nStay tuned for updates, and a big thank you to my incredible research team:\nN. Rattanachona (N\u0026rsquo;Fuse), P. Thungthin (N\u0026rsquo;Dear), N. Subsompon (N\u0026rsquo;Tien). Your hard work and dedication were essential to this project!\nHere I am, presenting our work on the Enhanced REG model and its application in detecting road assets!\nWe have visualizations of the detection results produced by the Enhanced REG model. The bounding boxes and labels demonstrate the model’s ability to accurately locate and classify objects. These visuals reflect the high-resolution output and the model’s performance in detecting road assets in various environments. The clarity of these results illustrates the practical utility of our model in real-time applications. It effectively showcases how our model handles complex and dynamic scenes.\nGeneralized Focal Loss for Multi-Class Detection The detection task focuses on identifying seven key classes of road assets: Pavilions, Pedestrian bridges, Information signs, Single-arm poles, Bus stops, Warning signs, and Concrete guardrails (Fig. 3). The challenge lies in dealing with class imbalance — smaller and harder-to-detect objects can be easily overlooked by traditional object detection models. We address this by utilizing Generalized Focal Loss (GFL), which extends the classical Focal Loss to multi-class detection, giving more focus to underrepresented and challenging classes.\nFig. 3. My proposed Generalized Focal Loss for multi-class detection tackles class imbalance across seven asset classes. By extending Focal Loss, we improve detection accuracy for small and difficult-to-classify objects.\nRefined Generalized Focal Loss for Segmentation For the segmentation task, we detect road assets at the pixel level, focusing on five classes: Pavilions, Pedestrian bridges, Information signs, Warning signs, and Concrete guardrails (Fig. 4). The key here is to ensure that every pixel is correctly classified into one of these categories, which is a non-trivial problem in cluttered highway imagery. My Refined Generalized Focal Loss applies pixel-wise loss calculation, extending GFL into the realm of segmentation.\nFig. 4. The segmentation process classifies each pixel into one of five road asset classes, using Refined Generalized Focal Loss to enhance pixel-wise accuracy in segmentation tasks.\nNow, let’s look at a real-world application of our Enhanced REG model in detecting road assets. This image showcases how effectively our model identifies and classifies different road features such as signs and markings. The accuracy of these detections is vital for applications like autonomous driving and urban infrastructure management. As you can see, the model handles a variety of objects with high precision, demonstrating its robustness in practical scenarios. This performance underscores the model\u0026rsquo;s potential for real-world deployment.\nThis chart presents a comparison of performance metrics between our Enhanced REG model and previous versions. We observe significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score. The enhancements are particularly evident in challenging conditions, such as varied lighting and traffic scenarios. These metrics highlight the effectiveness of our model\u0026rsquo;s enhancements. By achieving superior results, our approach sets a new benchmark in object detection accuracy.\nFinally, this image illustrates the training process for the Enhanced REG model. It depicts the stages of optimization and fine-tuning, with various datasets and augmentation techniques used to enhance the model’s performance. The iterative process shown here is crucial for achieving the high accuracy demonstrated in our results. Observing these training phases provides insights into how we refined the model. This rigorous approach is key to ensuring the model’s effectiveness and reliability in practical applications.\nRefinement Term for Spatial-Contextual Learning To further enhance learning, we introduce a spatial-contextual refinement term $(g_{i,c})$ that dynamically adjusts the loss based on the geometric and contextual significance of each object class (Fig. 5). This term allows the model to account for the spatial distribution of road assets, making it more adept at handling complex scenes typical of real-world road environments.\nFig. 5. The refinement term \\(g_{i,c}\\) adjusts the loss based on spatial and contextual relevance, improving model learning in complex and cluttered road scenes.\nJoint Optimization for Detection and Segmentation We then integrate the detection and segmentation tasks into a joint optimization framework. By combining the losses for both tasks (Fig. 6), the model learns complementary representations, allowing it to improve both object detection and pixel-wise segmentation accuracy. This joint approach ensures that the model balances precision and recall across different road asset classes.\nFig. 6. Joint optimization balances detection and segmentation losses, enhancing performance across both tasks by learning complementary features.\nIncorporating Prediction Uncertainty To further refine REG, we incorporated prediction uncertainty using a Gaussian distribution (Fig. 7). This technique accounts for the inherent noise and ambiguity in complex environments, particularly under varying lighting and cluttered backgrounds, thereby improving both robustness and accuracy.\nFig. 7. We model prediction uncertainty using a Gaussian distribution to handle noise and ambiguity, particularly in challenging road scenes.\nMathematical Foundations for Optimization in REG The optimization of REG is based on advanced techniques in stochastic optimization, where we extend traditional gradient descent to operate on Riemannian Manifolds (Fig. 8). Given the non-convex nature of the loss landscape, we utilize variational inference, proximal gradient methods, and Lagrangian multipliers, allowing for efficient optimization in multi-task learning.\nFig. 8. Advanced mathematical techniques, including Riemannian stochastic gradient descent, underpin the optimization of REG in complex, high-dimensional spaces.\nPerformance Analysis for Detection and Segmentation Finally, we tested the model\u0026rsquo;s performance on both detection (Fig. 9) and segmentation tasks (Fig. 10). REG demonstrated significant improvements in mAP50, F1-score, and other key metrics, showcasing its capability to handle both high-overlap detection and detailed mask segmentation.\nFig. 9. REG outperforms other models in detection tasks, especially in high-overlap scenarios, with superior mAP50 and F1 scores.\nFig. 10. The segmentation performance of REG shows exceptional accuracy in generating precise masks, particularly in challenging environments.\nthis work introduces Refined Generalized Focal Loss (REG), which significantly improves the detection and segmentation of road assets in complex environments. By applying advanced mathematical techniques and integrating spatial-contextual learning, REG addresses the challenges of class imbalance and localization in highway asset detection. The mathematical insights behind this model, including optimization on Riemannian manifolds and probabilistic refinement, provide a robust framework for future improvements in vision-based infrastructure management systems.\nFor those interested in exploring the full mathematical derivation and code, please check out the REG: Refined Generalized Focal Loss on GitHub.\nRecap: A Journey Through Road Asset Detection and Segmentation on Thai Highways Understanding the Scene Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re driving along a bustling Thai highway, surrounded by a landscape dotted with various road assets. These assets include everything from pavilions providing shade and rest areas, pedestrian bridges allowing safe crossing, and information signs guiding motorists, to single-arm poles supporting traffic signals, bus stops, warning signs alerting drivers of upcoming hazards, and concrete guardrails safeguarding the road\u0026rsquo;s edge. Each of these elements plays a critical role in ensuring the safety and efficiency of the highway system.\nThe Challenge: Detection and Segmentation To manage and maintain these assets effectively, automated systems are employed to detect and segment these features from images captured along the highway. This process involves two main tasks: detection and segmentation.\nDetection Tasks:\nIn detection, the goal is to identify and locate these assets within images. For the Thai highways, there are seven specific classes of road assets to detect:\nPavilions: Structures offering shade and rest for travelers. Pedestrian Bridges: Elevated walkways ensuring safe crossing over the highway. Information Signs: Signs providing crucial information to drivers. Single-Arm Poles: Posts supporting traffic signals or cameras. Bus Stops: Designated areas where buses pick up and drop off passengers. Warning Signs: Signs alerting drivers to potential hazards ahead. Concrete Guardrails: Barriers designed to prevent vehicles from veering off the road. Segmentation Tasks:\nSegmentation takes this a step further by assigning a specific class label to each pixel in the image, providing a detailed map of where each type of asset is located. For the Thai highways, the segmentation focuses on five classes:\nPavilions: Highlighted as areas of rest and shelter. Pedestrian Bridges: Marked to show their location and coverage. Information Signs: Detailed to ensure visibility and accessibility. Warning Signs: Identified to enhance hazard awareness. Concrete Guardrails: Outlined to confirm their placement along the road. The Process in Action 1. Detection:\nPicture an advanced AI system analyzing highway images. It scans each image to detect the seven classes of road assets. Using bounding boxes, the system outlines each asset\u0026rsquo;s location, distinguishing between the pavilions providing shade and the concrete guardrails ensuring safety. This detection process helps in cataloging and managing each asset efficiently.\n2. Segmentation:\nMoving to segmentation, the AI system processes the same images to create a detailed pixel-level map. Each pixel in the image is classified into one of the five categories, such as pavilions, pedestrian bridges, and warning signs. This precise classification allows for a thorough understanding of where each asset is situated, helping with tasks like maintenance scheduling and safety assessments.\nReal-World Impact This dual approach—detection and segmentation—ensures that every asset along the Thai highways is accurately identified and mapped. For instance, knowing the exact location of warning signs can help in assessing their visibility and effectiveness. Similarly, detailed segmentation of concrete guardrails aids in monitoring their condition and integrity.\nPaper Highlights: Our research addresses a critical issue in road safety: detecting key road assets such as pedestrian bridges, pavilions, signs, and concrete guardrails. We implemented an enhanced REG model integrated with Generalized Focal Loss, which significantly improves detection accuracy, especially in complex environments with diverse lighting and backgrounds.\nComprehensive Analysis of Generalized Focal Loss and Last Layer Architectures In computer vision, both object detection and semantic segmentation are crucial tasks that leverage different approaches and final layer architectures in deep learning models. This document provides an in-depth technical overview of Generalized Focal Loss applied to both tasks, and a detailed comparison of the final layers used in each.\nGeneralized Focal Loss for Vision Tasks Generalized Focal Loss (GFL) is designed to address class imbalance and focus learning on hard-to-detect objects by adjusting the standard focal loss. This approach is applicable to both detection and segmentation tasks but is formulated slightly differently for each.\nObjective: In object detection, GFL helps to improve the accuracy of detecting objects and managing class imbalance by focusing on harder-to-detect objects.\nMathematical Formula:\nFor detection tasks involving multiple classes (e.g., Pavilions, Pedestrian Bridges, etc.), the Generalized Focal Loss is given by:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{GFL}}^{\\text{Detection}} = - \\alpha \\left(1 - p_t\\right)^\\gamma \\log(p_t) $$\nWhere:\n$p_t$ represents the predicted probability for the correct class. $\\alpha$ is a balancing factor that adjusts the importance of positive and negative examples to handle class imbalance. $\\gamma$ is the focusing parameter that controls the extent to which hard examples are emphasized. Higher values of $\\gamma$ increase the focus on difficult examples. For detecting objects like Pedestrian Bridges or Concrete Guardrails, which may appear in challenging conditions, GFL reduces the weight of easy examples and enhances the learning from complex cases, such as those with partial occlusions or poor lighting. Explaining the Two Samples: Detection and Segmentation For detection, consider a scenario where we need to locate a Pavilion on a highway. The Generalized Focal Loss helps reduce the loss contribution from easily detected Pavilions—those that are in clear view—and shifts the model\u0026rsquo;s focus to harder cases, like Pavilions that may be partially obscured by other objects or in poor lighting. By emphasizing these challenging examples, the model improves its overall performance on diverse highway scenes.\nFor segmentation, imagine the task of segmenting an Information Sign pixel by pixel. Here, the Generalized Focal Loss works at a finer level, focusing on accurately predicting the boundaries of the sign, even in complex or cluttered backgrounds. The model learns to pay more attention to pixels where it’s less confident, which results in sharper and more accurate segmentation outcomes.\nThis dual application of the Generalized Focal Loss—both for bounding box detection and for pixel-level segmentation—enables our model to excel in both tasks, effectively handling the complexities of road asset management in real-world highway conditions.\nIn the images, we’re showcasing a progression of deep learning techniques. Starting with (a) as the original input and (b) as the expected target output, we then move through different versions of REG—(c) REGn, (d) REGs, (e) REGm, (f) REGl, and (g) REGx. Now, the key point to note is that (f) and (g) highlight our proposed enhancement, where we’ve integrated a refined Generalized Focal Loss into YOLO. What’s impressive here is that you’ll see it clearly outperforms the other methods, especially in both detection (bounding boxes) and segmentation (pixel-based).\nThe first image focuses on detection, showing the bounding box results. Meanwhile, the second image dives deeper into instance segmentation, illustrating pixel-level accuracy.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s break it down. In the first image, you\u0026rsquo;ll see how each version of REG handles object detection by drawing bounding boxes around the identified objects. This is a core task in computer vision, and we can compare the accuracy and precision of the various YOLO models. With our enhanced method using the refined Generalized Focal Loss, which we\u0026rsquo;ve integrated into REGl and REGx, you’ll notice a significant improvement in the clarity and correctness of the bounding boxes. These results indicate that our approach performs better at accurately locating objects in the images.\nNext, in the second image, the focus shifts to instance segmentation, where instead of just detecting objects with boxes, we’re identifying the exact pixel regions for each object. This is a more complex task that requires higher precision. Here again, our enhanced REG models stand out. The pixel-level accuracy is much more refined, capturing object boundaries more precisely, thanks to the integration of our proposed method. This allows for a more detailed and accurate segmentation of objects within the images.\nTo summarize, our proposed enhancements to the REG model—through the integration of refined Generalized Focal Loss—deliver significant improvements in both object detection and instance segmentation. The results across both images clearly demonstrate that our approach excels at accurately detecting and precisely segmenting objects. Whether it’s drawing clean bounding boxes or defining exact pixel regions, our method proves to be the clear winner. This shows that refining loss functions can have a big impact on model performance, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with deep learning in computer vision.\nFinal Insights: Pioneering Precision with REG in Highway Asset Detection 1. Introduction to Generalized Focal Loss In our paper, \u0026lsquo;Refined Generalized Focal Loss for Road Asset Detection on Thai Highways Using Vision-Based Detection and Segmentation Models\u0026rsquo;, we explore advancements in object detection and segmentation models tailored for detecting road assets on Thai highways. These assets include a variety of elements crucial for road safety and efficiency.\nGeneralized Focal Loss for Detection Tasks Generalized Focal Loss (GFL) is an enhancement over traditional focal loss, which aims to address class imbalance by focusing more on hard-to-detect objects. It introduces a dynamic focal weight that is adaptive to different classes, improving detection performance in complex scenarios.\nKey Equation for Detection The Generalized Focal Loss is formulated as: $[ \\text{GFL}_{\\text{det}} = - \\frac{1 - \\text{p}_i^{\\gamma}}{1 - \\text{p}_i} \\cdot \\text{log}(\\text{p}_i) ]$ where $\\text{p}_i$ is the predicted probability for the $i$-th class, and $\\gamma$ is the focusing parameter.\nGeneralized Focal Loss for Segmentation Tasks For segmentation tasks, GFL adapts by focusing on pixel-wise predictions, enhancing the model\u0026rsquo;s ability to handle imbalanced data and challenging regions within the images.\n2. Formula for Difference Between Detection and Segmentation Models The primary difference in the loss functions for detection and segmentation tasks is how they handle spatial versus class-level data. Detection models often deal with bounding boxes and class predictions, while segmentation models handle pixel-wise classification.\n3. Optimization in Object Detection and Segmentation Optimization in object detection and segmentation models involves tuning hyperparameters and adjusting learning rates to improve convergence and performance.\n4. Mathematical Formulas to Know Understanding the following formulas is crucial for implementing and refining GFL in detection and segmentation tasks:\nSoftmax Function: $[ \\text{softmax}(z_i) = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j} e^{z_j}} ]$ where $z_i$ is the score for class $i$.\nCross-Entropy Loss: $[ \\text{CrossEntropy}(y, \\hat{y}) = - \\sum_{i} y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i) ]$ where $y_i$ is the ground truth and $\\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted probability.\nDice Coefficient: $[ \\text{Dice} = \\frac{2 |A \\cap B|}{|A| + |B|} ]$ where $A$ and $B$ are the predicted and true segmentation masks.\nWhat’s Next? Our paper will undergo a fast-track formal review process for potential publication in the Transportmetrica A journal. We’re optimistic that this research will significantly contribute to highway engineering and road asset management fields.\nI’m genuinely excited to share our findings at iCHE 2024 and connect with the incredible minds in the field. I hope our research sparks inspiration in others, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. It would be truly rewarding if our work motivates even one person to contribute to something extraordinary in the world.

This moment was reminiscent of a recent analogy from HubSpot CTO Dharmesh Shah, who compared Netscape\u0026rsquo;s impact on the Internet to ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s influence on AI. Just as Netscape made the Internet accessible, ChatGPT is reshaping our understanding of AI, though its full effects on work and creativity remain uncertain.\nMicrosoft, now a major supporter of OpenAI (the creator of ChatGPT), is again at the forefront of this change, potentially challenging Google Search with ChatGPT integration into Bing. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers likened AI to a \u0026ldquo;caddie\u0026rdquo; that enhances our creativity and accuracy, though he cautioned against over-reliance on AI, which could lead to uniform and uninspired results. Summers also highlighted AI\u0026rsquo;s potential as a transformative technology, comparable to the printing press or electricity.\nKey Trends in Generative AI Advances in Model Architectures One of the most notable trends in generative AI is the development of advanced model architectures, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma \u0026 Welling, 2013), and Transformer-based models (Vaswani et al., 2017). These architectures have enabled the generation of high-quality content by learning complex data distributions. Growth in Computing Power and Data Availability The exponential growth in computing power and the availability of large datasets have been crucial in advancing generative AI. The use of GPUs and TPUs has accelerated the training of large models, while datasets like ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) and Common Crawl have provided diverse and extensive training data. Emerging Techniques and Approaches Recent innovations, such as few-shot and zero-shot learning, have expanded the capabilities of generative models.

For instance, GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, while models like DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021) can create novel images from textual descriptions. Healthcare In healthcare, generative AI has shown promise in drug discovery and medical imaging. For example, GANs have been used to generate realistic medical images for training purposes, improving diagnostic accuracy (Frid-Adar et al., 2018). Additionally, AI models can assist in designing new molecules with desired properties, expediting the drug development process. Gaming and Entertainment The gaming and entertainment industries have embraced generative AI to create immersive experiences. AI-generated characters, dialogues, and game levels enhance player engagement. Moreover, deepfake technology, powered by generative models, has opened new avenues in film and media production, allowing for realistic character portrayals and visual effects. Finance In finance, generative AI is utilized for algorithmic trading, risk management, and fraud detection. AI models can generate synthetic financial data to simulate market scenarios, aiding in the development of robust trading strategies (Wiese et al., 2019). Additionally, generative models can identify unusual patterns in transactions, enhancing fraud detection systems. For a deeper understanding of how LLMs are transforming finance, you can watch this insightful video: Autonomous Systems Generative AI plays a crucial role in autonomous systems, including robotics and self-driving cars. AI-generated simulations help in training and testing autonomous agents, reducing the reliance on real-world testing. For instance, generative models can simulate complex driving scenarios, improving the safety and reliability of self-driving technology (Dosovitskiy et al., 2017). Challenges and Ethical Considerations Bias and Fairness One of the significant challenges in generative AI is addressing bias and ensuring fairness. AI models may perpetuate societal biases present in the training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Researchers are actively exploring methods to detect and mitigate biases in generative models (Bender et al., 2021). Security and Privacy The rise of generative AI has raised concerns about security and privacy. Deepfake technology, for example, can be misused to create realistic but fake videos, leading to misinformation and privacy violations. Ensuring the responsible use of generative AI and developing techniques to detect synthetic content are crucial to addressing these issues (Chesney \u0026 Citron, 2019). Environmental Impact The training of large generative models requires substantial computational resources, contributing to the environmental impact. Researchers are exploring ways to reduce the carbon footprint of AI, such as developing energy-efficient algorithms and hardware (Strubell et al., 2019). Future Directions and Opportunities The future of generative AI holds immense potential, with opportunities for interdisciplinary applications and collaborations between academia and industry. As the technology continues to evolve, it is crucial to consider its societal implications and strive for responsible and ethical deployment. The integration of generative AI in various fields, from art to science, will likely lead to groundbreaking innovations and transformative experiences. Here is a simple Python code snippet demonstrating the basic structure of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch: Diffusion Model Implementation with Gaussian Diffusion This code demonstrates the implementation of a diffusion model using a U-Net-like architecture combined with a Gaussian diffusion process. The model consists of two primary classes:\nDiffusionModel Class:\nPurpose: Constructs an autoencoder architecture for processing and reconstructing images. The encoder extracts features from input images, while the decoder reconstructs the images from these features. Structure: Encoder: A series of convolutional layers that reduce spatial dimensions and increase feature channels. Decoder: A series of transposed convolutional layers that upsample feature maps to the original image size. Uses Tanh activation in the final layer to ensure pixel values are in the range of [-1, 1]. GaussianDiffusion Class:\nPurpose: Implements the Gaussian diffusion process, which includes both the forward (adding noise) and reverse (removing noise) diffusion steps. Components: Beta Schedule: Linearly increases noise levels over timesteps. Forward Diffusion Sample: Adds noise to the input image according to the current timestep. Reverse Diffusion Step: Uses the trained model to predict and remove noise from the image. Forward Method: Executes the reverse diffusion process over all timesteps to reconstruct the image from noisy data. Diffusion Sample Usage The example demonstrates how to:\nInitialize the DiffusionModel and GaussianDiffusion classes. Create a dummy image tensor. Perform forward diffusion to add noise and reverse diffusion to reconstruct the image. The code also includes a print statement to verify the shape of the reconstructed image, ensuring it matches the expected dimensions.\nThis setup provides a foundational framework for experimenting with diffusion models and can be adapted for various image processing and generation tasks. import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F import numpy as np # ## Diffusion Models # # Diffusion models are a cutting-edge approach in generative AI, particularly effective for image generation and editing tasks. They work by iteratively denoising data to recover the original distribution. The key concept is to reverse a diffusion process where noise is added and then removed to reconstruct the original data. # # The core objective function for diffusion models can be expressed as follows: # # C(x) = -1 / (σ √(2π)) * ((x - μ) / σ)² * exp(-0.5 * ((x - μ) / σ)²) # # Where: # - x is the data point. # - μ is the mean of the data distribution. # - σ is the standard deviation of the data distribution. # # Another formulation for the objective function is: # # L(x) = 0.5 * ((x - μ) / σ)² + 0.5 * log(2πσ²) # # Here: # - 0.5 * ((x - μ) / σ)² represents the squared deviation from the mean, which measures the distance between generated and target distributions. # - 0.5 * log(2πσ²) represents the entropy term that accounts for the normalization factor in the Gaussian distribution. # # In a more general form, related to a stochastic process: # # L(x) = E[0.5 * ||x - μ||² + 0.5 * log(2πσ²)] # # Where E denotes the expectation over the diffusion process, capturing the average cost of deviation. # # This objective function measures how well the model can reverse the diffusion process, minimizing the discrepancy between the true noise and the predicted noise. # # Modern diffusion models, such as those used in DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion, leverage extensive training on diverse datasets and incorporate additional conditioning information to enable precise control over generated images. # Define the main Diffusion Model class class DiffusionModel(nn.Module): def __init__(self, img_shape): super(DiffusionModel, self).__init__() # Encoder network: Extracts features from input images self.encoder = nn.Sequential( # Convolutional layer: Reduces spatial dimensions and increases feature channels nn.Conv2d(img_shape[0], 64, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1), nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True), nn.Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1), nn.BatchNorm2d(128), nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True), nn.Conv2d(128, 256, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1), nn.BatchNorm2d(256), nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True), nn.Conv2d(256, 512, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1), nn.BatchNorm2d(512), nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True) ) # Decoder network: Reconstructs images from feature maps self.decoder = nn.Sequential( # Transposed convolution layers: Upsample feature maps to original image size nn.ConvTranspose2d(512, 256, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1), nn.BatchNorm2d(256), nn.ReLU(inplace=True), nn.ConvTranspose2d(256, 128, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1), nn.BatchNorm2d(128), nn.ReLU(inplace=True), nn.ConvTranspose2d(128, 64, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1), nn.BatchNorm2d(64), nn.ReLU(inplace=True), nn.ConvTranspose2d(64, img_shape[0], kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1), nn.Tanh() # Output layer with Tanh activation to match image pixel values ) def forward(self, x): # Pass through encoder encoded = self.encoder(x) # Pass through decoder to reconstruct the image decoded = self.decoder(encoded) return decoded # Define the Gaussian Diffusion class class GaussianDiffusion(nn.Module): def __init__(self, model, timesteps=1000): super(GaussianDiffusion, self).__init__() self.model = model self.timesteps = timesteps # Initialize beta schedule and alpha parameters self.betas = self._linear_beta_schedule(timesteps) self.alphas = 1.0 - self.betas self.alpha_cumprod = np.cumprod(self.alphas) def _linear_beta_schedule(self, timesteps): # Linear schedule for beta values beta_start = 0.0001 beta_end = 0.02 return np.linspace(beta_start, beta_end, timesteps) def forward_diffusion_sample(self, x0, t): # Add noise to the input image based on the current timestep noise = torch.randn_like(x0) alpha_cumprod_t = self.alpha_cumprod[t] return torch.sqrt(alpha_cumprod_t) * x0 + torch.sqrt(1 - alpha_cumprod_t) * noise def reverse_diffusion_step(self, xt, t): # Predict noise and denoise the image pred_noise = self.model(xt) alpha_cumprod_t = self.alpha_cumprod[t] return (xt - torch.sqrt(1 - alpha_cumprod_t) * pred_noise) / torch.sqrt(alpha_cumprod_t) def forward(self, x): # Reverse diffusion process to reconstruct the image for t in reversed(range(self.timesteps)): x = self.reverse_diffusion_step(x, t) return x # Sample Input img_shape = (3, 64, 64) # Sample image shape: 3 channels (RGB), 64x64 pixels diffusion_model = DiffusionModel(img_shape) gaussian_diffusion = GaussianDiffusion(diffusion_model) # Dummy input: Random image tensor x0 = torch.randn((1, *img_shape)) # Batch size of 1 xt = gaussian_diffusion.forward_diffusion_sample(x0, t=500) # Add noise at timestep 500 x_reconstructed = gaussian_diffusion(xt) # Reconstruct the image from noisy input # Print the shape of the reconstructed image print(x_reconstructed.shape) # Should print torch.Size([1, 3, 64, 64]) Diffusion Models Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach in generative AI, especially for tasks involving image generation and editing. These models iteratively denoise images to recover the original data distribution. The objective function for diffusion models can be expressed as: $$ C(x) = -\\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\left(\\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2} $$ Where:\n$x$ represents the data point. $\\mu$ represents the mean of the data distribution. $\\sigma$ represents the standard deviation of the data distribution. $$ L(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\log(2 \\pi \\sigma^2) $$\nIn this form:\n$( \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)^2 )$ represents the squared deviation from the mean, often used in diffusion models to measure the distance between generated and target distributions. $( \\frac{1}{2} \\log(2 \\pi \\sigma^2) )$ represents the entropy term, which accounts for the normalization factor in the Gaussian distribution. You can also represent the diffusion objective function in a more general form related to a stochastic process:\n$$ L(x) = \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} | x - \\mu |^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\log(2 \\pi \\sigma^2) \\right] $$\nHere, $( \\mathbb{E} )$ denotes the expectation over the diffusion process, capturing the average cost.\nThis objective function measures the discrepancy between the true noise added to the data and the noise predicted by the model, aiming to train the model to accurately reverse the diffusion process.\nWhere: \\(x_t\\) is the noised image at timestep \\(t\\), and \\(\\epsilon_\\theta\\) is the noise prediction network. Recent works like DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion have demonstrated the remarkable capabilities of diffusion models in text-to-image generation and image editing tasks. These models leverage large-scale training on diverse datasets and incorporate additional conditioning information to enable fine-grained control over generated images. GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Goodfellow et al. in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other in a zero-sum game framework. The generator aims to generate realistic data samples, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between real and generated samples. The objective functions for GANs can be expressed as follows: $$ L_{\\text{GAN}} = \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_x{\\text{data}(x)}} [\\log D(x)] + \\text{generated data samples} $$\nWhere:\n$G$ represents the generator network. $D$ represents the discriminator network. $x$ represents the real data sample. $z$ represents the random noise vector sampled from a prior distribution $p_z(z)$. $p_{\\text{data}(x)}$ represents the data distribution. In this form:\n$\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_x{\\text{data}(x)}} [\\log D(x)]$ represents the expected value of the discriminator\u0026rsquo;s output for real data samples. $\\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p_z(z)} [\\log (1 - D(G(z)))]$ represents the expected value of the discriminator\u0026rsquo;s output for generated data samples. The generator aims to minimize this objective while the discriminator aims to maximize it.\nSelf-Supervised Learning Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a paradigm in machine learning where the model learns to generate labels from the input data itself, without requiring manually labeled data. This approach uses pretext tasks to learn representations that can be transferred to downstream tasks. One common objective in self-supervised learning is the contrastive loss, which can be expressed as: $$ L_{\\text{contrastive}} = -\\log \\frac{\\exp(\\text{sim}(h_i, h_j)/\\tau)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{2N} \\mathbb{1}_{[k \\neq i]} \\exp(\\text{sim}(h_i, h_k)/\\tau)} $$\nWhere:\n$h_i$ and $h_j$ represent the encoded representations of positive pairs. $\\text{sim}(h_i, h_j)$ represents the similarity measure between $h_i$ and $h_j$. $\\tau$ represents the temperature parameter. $N$ represents the number of samples. $\\mathbb{1}_{[k \\neq i]}$ is an indicator function that is 1 if $k \\neq i$ and 0 otherwise. In this form:\n$\\exp(\\text{sim}(h_i, h_j)/\\tau)$ represents the exponential of the similarity between the positive pairs scaled by the temperature. The denominator sums the exponential similarities of all pairs except the identical ones. This objective encourages the model to bring similar samples closer in the representation space and push dissimilar ones apart.\nAdversarial Attacks Adversarial attacks involve manipulating input data to deceive machine learning models into making incorrect predictions. One common method is the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), which perturbs the input data in the direction of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input. The formula for generating an adversarial example using FGSM can be expressed as: $$ x_{\\text{adv}} = x + \\epsilon \\cdot \\text{sign}(\\nabla_x J(\\theta, x, y)) $$\nWhere:\n$x_{\\text{adv}}$ represents the adversarial example. $x$ represents the original input data. $\\epsilon$ represents the perturbation magnitude. $\\nabla_x J(\\theta, x, y)$ represents the gradient of the loss function $J$ with respect to the input $x$. $J(\\theta, x, y)$ represents the loss function of the model. $\\theta$ represents the model parameters. $y$ represents the true label of the input data. In this form:\n$\\text{sign}(\\nabla_x J(\\theta, x, y))$ represents the sign of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input, indicating the direction to perturb the input to maximize the loss. The adversarial example $x_{\\text{adv}}$ is created by adding this perturbation to the original input.

With the advent of satellites like Sentinel, Landsat-8, and THEOS, we have access to a plethora of high-resolution imagery that can be used for various applications, including Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification and image classification. However, analyzing and interpreting this vast amount of data is a complex task. Enter Large Language Models (LLMs), which have shown promise in various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and remote sensing. In this blog, we will explore how LLMs can be applied to remote sensing, particularly in the domains of LULC and image classification. We will delve into the methodologies, algorithms, and techniques that can be utilized to harness the power of LLMs for these applications. Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) Large Language Models, such as GPT-4, are deep learning models that have been trained on vast amounts of text data. They are capable of understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly versatile for various applications. In the context of remote sensing, LLMs can be used to analyze and interpret imagery data, aiding in tasks like LULC classification and image classification. LLMs in LULC Classification LULC classification involves categorizing different regions of an image into land use and land cover classes, such as forests, urban areas, water bodies, and agricultural land. Traditional methods for LULC classification include supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. LLMs, however, can enhance these methods by providing contextual understanding and improved feature extraction. Methodology The process of using LLMs for LULC classification can be summarized as follows: Data Preprocessing:\nCollect satellite imagery from sources like Sentinel, Landsat-8, and THEOS. Perform image correction and normalization to ensure consistency in the data. Feature Extraction:\nUse convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from the satellite images. Integrate LLMs to enhance feature extraction by incorporating contextual information from related text data (e.g., environmental reports, land use documentation). Model Training:\nTrain a classification model using the extracted features. The model can be a hybrid of CNNs and LLMs, where the CNN handles the spatial features and the LLM provides contextual understanding. Classification and Validation:\nApply the trained model to classify the satellite images into LULC categories. Validate the model using ground truth data and performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Case Study: LULC Classification on Sentinel-2 Imagery To illustrate the application of LLMs in LULC classification, let’s consider a case study using Sentinel-2 imagery. Sentinel-2 provides high-resolution optical imagery, which is ideal for detailed LULC classification. Data Collection and Preprocessing We collected Sentinel-2 imagery for a region with diverse land cover types. The images were preprocessed to correct for atmospheric effects and normalize the reflectance values. Feature Extraction A pre-trained CNN, such as ResNet-50, was used to extract spatial features from the images. Simultaneously, a large corpus of environmental text data was fed into an LLM to extract contextual features. Model Training and Classification The extracted features were combined and fed into a hybrid classification model. The model was trained using labeled ground truth data. The results showed a significant improvement in classification accuracy compared to traditional methods. Conclusion The integration of LLMs in remote sensing, particularly for LULC and image classification, holds immense potential. By combining the spatial feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the contextual understanding of LLMs, we can achieve more accurate and meaningful classifications. As remote sensing technology continues to evolve, the role of advanced AI models like LLMs will become increasingly crucial in unlocking new insights from satellite imagery. In this blog, we explored the methodologies and techniques for leveraging LLMs in remote sensing applications. The case study on Sentinel-2 imagery demonstrated the practical benefits of this approach. As we move forward, further research and development in this field will undoubtedly lead to more innovative and effective solutions for remote sensing challenges.

In regions like Thailand, where agriculture is central to the economy, precise segmentation of satellite imagery can enhance our ability to track crop health, predict yields, and improve resource management. Our model, MeViT (Medium-Resolution Vision Transformer), is specifically designed to classify agricultural crops like para rubber, corn, and pineapple across Thailand’s varied landscapes.\nBackground on Vision Transformers Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are excellent at capturing local spatial hierarchies, Vision Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms. This unique structure allows MeViT to interpret both local and global features, enhancing its effectiveness in agricultural land segmentation tasks where accuracy and detail are paramount.\nMeViT Architecture MeViT leverages a multi-branch architecture tailored for medium-resolution images, balancing computational efficiency with high-quality feature extraction. This design approach enables the model to capture details across multiple spatial scales, which is crucial for segmenting complex land use patterns in agricultural imagery.\nIn particular, the revised mixed-scale convolutional feedforward network (MixCFN) in MeViT incorporates multiple depth-wise convolution paths, further refining feature extraction by allowing the model to focus on different spatial scales. This enhanced architecture achieves an efficient trade-off between model complexity and performance, making it well-suited for large-scale image analysis tasks.\nExperimental Results and Evaluation We extensively tested MeViT on Thailand’s Landsat-8 dataset, focusing on para rubber, corn, and pineapple classifications. Compared to other models, including state-of-the-art architectures like HRViT and SegFormer, MeViT demonstrated notable improvements in precision and segmentation accuracy, proving its efficacy in challenging, real-world datasets. This establishes MeViT as a leading tool in medium-resolution satellite imagery analysis, surpassing previous Vision Transformer models and CNN-based methods in delivering high-quality semantic segmentation.\nConclusion MeViT presents a significant advancement in Vision Transformer applications, setting a new standard for semantic segmentation in remote sensing. By combining multi-branch ViT architectures with optimized convolutional modules, MeViT delivers efficient, accurate LULC classification on satellite imagery, supporting agricultural insights and sustainable resource management across Thailand. This work contributes to the broader field of environmental monitoring and opens up new possibilities for enhanced remote sensing techniques globally.\n","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682899200,"objectID":"14c0ff27b66af589b9731863f8bf9193","permalink":"https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/publication/mevit-a-medium-resolution-vision-transformer/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mevit-a-medium-resolution-vision-transformer/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we present MeViT (Medium-Resolution Vision Transformer), designed for semantic segmentation of Landsat satellite imagery, focusing on key economic crops in Thailand para rubber, corn, and pineapple.

The prevailing model at the time was the Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder (DCED), which faced limitations in accuracy due to its inability to recover low-level features, such as rivers and low vegetation, and the scarcity of training data.\nMy thesis tackled these issues by introducing a novel semantic segmentation architecture tailored for remote sensing. Key innovations included:\nGlobal Convolutional Network (GCN): A modern CNN architecture designed to enhance feature extraction. Channel Attention: An approach to select the most discriminative filters for improved feature representation. Domain-Specific Transfer Learning: A technique to address the issue of limited training data. Feature Fusion (FF): An addition to capture and integrate low-level features effectively. Depthwise Atrous Convolution (DA): A method to refine extracted features for greater accuracy. These advancements were validated through experiments on three datasets: two private corpora from Landsat-8 satellite and one public benchmark from the ISPRS Vaihingen challenge.

A deep convolutional encoder–decoder (DCED) network is the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation method for remotely sensed images. However, the accuracy is still limited, since the network is not designed for remotely sensed images and the training data in this domain is deficient. In this paper, we aim to propose a novel CNN for semantic segmentation particularly for remote sensing corpora with three main contributions. First, we propose applying a recent CNN called a global convolutional network (GCN), since it can capture different resolutions by extracting multi-scale features from different stages of the network. Additionally, we further enhance the network by improving its backbone using larger numbers of layers, which is suitable for medium resolution remotely sensed images. Second, “channel attention” is presented in our network in order to select the most discriminative filters (features). Third, “domain-specific transfer learning” is introduced to alleviate the scarcity issue by utilizing other remotely sensed corpora with different resolutions as pre-trained data. The experiment was then conducted on two given datasets (i) medium resolution data collected from Landsat-8 satellite and (ii) very high resolution data called the ISPRS Vaihingen Challenge Dataset. The results show that our networks outperformed DCED in terms of 𝐹1 for 17.48% and 2.49% on medium and very high resolution corpora, respectively.","tags":["Global Convolutional Network","Transfer Learning","Channel Attention","Remote Sensing","Discriminative Filters"],"title":"Semantic Segmentation on Remotely Sensed Images Using an Enhanced Global Convolutional Network with Channel Attention and Domain Specific Transfer Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

As of now, colonoscopy is the most effective screening tool for diagnosing colorectal cancer by searching for polyps which can develop into colon cancer. The drawback of manual colonoscopy process is its high polyp miss rate. Therefore, polyp detection is a crucial issue in the development of colonoscopy application. Despite having high evaluation scores, the recently published methods based on fully convolutional network (FCN) require a very long inferring (testing) time that cannot be applied in a real clinical process due to a large number of parameters in the network. In this paper, we proposed a compressed fully convolutional network by modifying the FCN-8s network, so our network is able to detect and segment polyp from video images within a real-time constraint in a practical screening routine. Furthermore, our customized loss function allows our network to be more robust when compared to the traditional cross-entropy loss function. The experiment was conducted on CVC-EndoSceneStill database which consists of 912 video frames from 36 patients. Our proposed framework has obtained state-of-the-art results while running more than 7 times faster and requiring fewer weight parameters by more than 9 times. The experimental results convey that our system has the potential to support clinicians during the analysis of colonoscopy video by automatically indicating the suspicious polyps locations.","tags":["Colorectal Cancer","Fully Convolutional Network","CVC-EndoSceneStill","Colonoscopy Video"],"title":"Real-Time Polyps Segmentation for Colonoscopy Video Frames Using Compressed Fully Convolutional Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Many applications, such as urban planning, change detection, and environmental monitoring, require the accurate segmentation; hence, most segmentation tasks are performed by humans. Currently, with the growth of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), there are many works aiming to find the best network architecture fitting for this task. However, all of the studies are based on very-high resolution satellite images, and surprisingly; none of them are implemented on medium resolution satellite images. Moreover, no research has applied geoinformatics knowledge. Therefore, we purpose to compare the semantic segmentation models, which are FCN, SegNet, and GSN using medium resolution images from Landsat-8 satellite. In addition, we propose a modified SegNet model that can be used with remote sensing derived indices. The results show that the model that achieves the highest accuracy RGB bands of medium resolution aerial imagery is SegNet. The overall accuracy of the model increases when includes Near Infrared (NIR) and Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) band.

This paper introduces an enhanced DCNN framework specifically designed for road extraction from remote sensing images by incorporating landscape metrics (LMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs). Our framework employs the exponential linear unit (ELU) activation function to improve the DCNN, leading to a higher quantity and more accurate road extraction. Additionally, to minimize false classifications of road objects, we propose a solution based on the integration of LMs. To further refine the extracted roads, a CRF method is incorporated into our framework.
