🚀 <b>Representation Learning • Diffusion Models • Geospatial AI</b>
</p>

---

This repository serves as my **personal research and engineering workspace**, collecting projects, prototypes, and research artifacts at the intersection of:

- 🧠 **Representation Learning & Generative Models**
- 🌫️ **Diffusion Models & Stochastic Processes**
- 📐 **Optimization Theory for Deep Learning**
- 🌍 **Geospatial AI & Remote Sensing at Scale**

My work emphasizes **mathematically grounded AI systems**—where optimization theory, probabilistic modeling, and geometric structure are treated as first-class design principles, not afterthoughts.

---

## 🧠 Research Focus

I am particularly interested in:

- **Latent-space optimization** for generative models  
- **Diffusion-based inverse problems** (inpainting, restoration, uncertainty-aware generation)  
- **Kernel methods and adaptive optimization** in high-dimensional spaces  
- **Scalable learning for very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery**  

These themes sit at the boundary between **theory-driven AI** and **large-scale real-world deployment**.

## ✨ Research Philosophy

> *“Good AI systems emerge when optimization, probability, and geometry are treated explicitly—not hidden behind heuristics.”*

I value:
- 📐 **Mathematical rigor in model design**
- 🧪 **Reproducible, inspectable experiments**
- 🏗️ **Systems that scale beyond toy benchmarks**
- 📖 **Clear articulation of assumptions and limitations**

---

## 🛠️ Technical Scope

- **Core Stack**: Python, PyTorch  
- **Modeling**: Diffusion Models, Latent Variable Models, Kernel Methods  
- **Theory**: Optimization, Stochastic Processes, Probabilistic Inference  
- **Domains**: Computer Vision, Remote Sensing, Geospatial Intelligence  
- **Systems**: GPU inference pipelines, research-to-production workflows
