      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, it’s me again, &lt;strong&gt;Kao Panboonyuen&lt;/strong&gt;—welcome back to my blog! 😊 Today, I’m diving into a topic that’s been on my mind a lot lately: the exciting intersection of &lt;strong&gt;Remote Sensing&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs)&lt;/strong&gt;. As you know, &lt;strong&gt;remote sensing&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the most powerful tools for understanding the Earth’s surface, using &lt;strong&gt;satellite systems&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;strong&gt;Sentinel-2&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Landsat-8&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;THEOS&lt;/strong&gt; to capture tons of &lt;strong&gt;high-resolution data&lt;/strong&gt;. From monitoring &lt;strong&gt;environmental changes&lt;/strong&gt; to assisting in &lt;strong&gt;urban planning&lt;/strong&gt;, this data has countless applications. But here’s the catch—while we have all this amazing data at our fingertips, its sheer volume and complexity can overwhelm traditional methods of &lt;strong&gt;data classification&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older algorithms like &lt;strong&gt;Support Vector Machines (SVM)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Random Forest (RF)&lt;/strong&gt; have done a decent job, but they often struggle to tap into the &lt;strong&gt;deeper semantic meaning&lt;/strong&gt; within the data. They can classify pixels, sure, but they can’t grasp the rich, contextual relationships between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where &lt;strong&gt;LLMs&lt;/strong&gt; come in! These models, originally built for &lt;strong&gt;natural language processing&lt;/strong&gt;, have the power to &lt;strong&gt;revolutionize remote sensing&lt;/strong&gt; by interpreting and analyzing data on a much deeper level. By &lt;strong&gt;integrating contextual insights&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;satellite metadata&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;environmental reports&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;LLMs&lt;/strong&gt; can enhance tasks like &lt;strong&gt;LULC (Land Use/Land Cover) classification&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;image analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. The results? Much more accurate and insightful interpretations of satellite imagery, opening up a whole new world of possibilities for &lt;strong&gt;remote sensing applications&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote sensing&lt;/strong&gt; has become an indispensable tool for gaining detailed insights into the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface, with satellite systems like &lt;strong&gt;Sentinel-2&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Landsat-8&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;THEOS&lt;/strong&gt; providing an endless stream of &lt;strong&gt;high-resolution data&lt;/strong&gt;. From &lt;strong&gt;environmental monitoring&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;urban planning&lt;/strong&gt;, this data fuels critical applications across a range of sectors. Yet, the vast volume and &lt;strong&gt;complexity&lt;/strong&gt; of satellite imagery can present a significant challenge. Traditional methods of &lt;strong&gt;data classification&lt;/strong&gt;, such as &lt;strong&gt;Support Vector Machines (SVM)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Random Forest (RF)&lt;/strong&gt;, have delivered valuable results but are often unable to capture the full &lt;strong&gt;semantic richness&lt;/strong&gt; embedded within this data. They excel at processing large datasets, but struggle when tasked with understanding the deeper, contextual relationships between the elements within these images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the era of &lt;strong&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs)&lt;/strong&gt;, which are revolutionizing the way we process and interpret remote sensing data. Originally designed to understand and generate &lt;strong&gt;human-like language&lt;/strong&gt;, LLMs have demonstrated an incredible capacity to enhance &lt;strong&gt;data analysis&lt;/strong&gt; by integrating &lt;strong&gt;contextual information&lt;/strong&gt; from multiple sources—such as &lt;strong&gt;environmental reports&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;satellite metadata&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;geospatial context&lt;/strong&gt;. This ability to handle &lt;strong&gt;multimodal data&lt;/strong&gt; opens up new avenues for more accurate &lt;strong&gt;Land Use/Land Cover (LULC)&lt;/strong&gt; classification and &lt;strong&gt;image interpretation&lt;/strong&gt;, driving improvements in remote sensing applications that were once constrained by traditional algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent Twitter post, &lt;strong&gt;Lilian Weng&lt;/strong&gt; excitedly shared the launch of &lt;strong&gt;Thinking Machines Lab&lt;/strong&gt;, a cutting-edge AI research and product company dedicated to pushing the boundaries of &lt;strong&gt;multimodal understanding&lt;/strong&gt;. As she mentions, the lab is home to some of the brightest minds behind innovations like &lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;. Their focus on multimodal AI is particularly relevant to the work being done with &lt;strong&gt;Vision–Language Models (VLMs)&lt;/strong&gt;, which are rapidly transforming how we analyze remote sensing data. Just like &lt;strong&gt;Thinking Machines Lab&lt;/strong&gt; aims to integrate various AI disciplines to achieve greater synergy, &lt;strong&gt;VLMs&lt;/strong&gt; are creating new possibilities for understanding &lt;strong&gt;satellite imagery&lt;/strong&gt; by combining &lt;strong&gt;computer vision&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;natural language processing&lt;/strong&gt;. This shift not only enhances our ability to interpret complex data but also paves the way for more intuitive, human-like understanding of the world around us.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;visionlanguage-models-vlms&#34;&gt;Vision–Language Models (VLMs)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, &lt;strong&gt;Vision–Language Models (VLMs)&lt;/strong&gt; have emerged as a groundbreaking tool in remote sensing, particularly in enhancing the interpretation of satellite imagery. These models merge visual data with linguistic understanding, offering a more holistic approach to analyzing complex remote sensing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting developments in this area is how VLMs can enrich traditional remote sensing datasets. While traditional datasets often rely purely on raw imagery, VLMs leverage contextual relationships between visual inputs and textual data, providing more nuanced insights. The integration of textual descriptions or geospatial metadata alongside imagery allows for a deeper understanding of land use, land cover changes, and other environmental factors. This ability is showcased in a comparative visualization, where you can clearly see how VLM datasets offer richer and more detailed information than traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of VLMs lies not just in their ability to process images, but also in their proficiency at handling a variety of tasks simultaneously. For instance, these models can assist in tasks such as object detection, classification, and even scene understanding. A representation of these tasks reveals just how versatile VLMs can be across different domains of remote sensing. From simple land cover classification to more complex tasks like environmental monitoring, VLMs are equipped to tackle them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we dig deeper into the structure of VLMs, it becomes clear that they come in various forms, each designed to handle specific challenges in remote sensing. For example, &lt;strong&gt;contrastive models&lt;/strong&gt; focus on matching images with descriptive text, while &lt;strong&gt;conversational models&lt;/strong&gt; are more dynamic, enabling interactive querying and real-time interpretation of satellite imagery. This distinction in architecture allows VLMs to be adaptable to a wide range of applications, from automatic image captioning to detailed environmental analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to their core functionality, enhancement techniques are often employed to refine VLM performance. Some layers of the model are &lt;strong&gt;fine-tuned&lt;/strong&gt; to improve precision, while others are kept &lt;strong&gt;frozen&lt;/strong&gt; to preserve previously learned features. These techniques are crucial for boosting model efficiency without overfitting, ensuring that VLMs can be effectively applied to large-scale remote sensing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing interest in VLMs is also reflected in the increasing number of academic publications dedicated to this field. Over the past few years, the volume of research in the intersection of VLMs and remote sensing has surged, reflecting the potential of these models to transform how we understand and analyze satellite data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_SAMPLE_RS_LLMS_00001.png&#34; alt=&#34;Comparison of traditional and VLM datasets in remote sensing&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Figure 1: A comparative analysis between traditional and Vision–Language Model (VLM) datasets in the context of remote sensing. Traditional datasets typically rely on isolated visual data (such as satellite images) for classification and interpretation, often limited by the scope of raw pixel-based information. In contrast, VLM datasets integrate both visual and textual modalities, incorporating contextual information like environmental reports, geospatial metadata, and textual descriptions. This hybrid approach enhances the model&#39;s ability to capture complex relationships and nuanced patterns in satellite imagery, improving classification accuracy and providing richer insights for land use/land cover (LULC) analysis and other remote sensing tasks. (Image source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/1/162&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MDPI&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in the visual comparison above, the shift from traditional datasets to VLM datasets in remote sensing is not just about increasing data volume but about enhancing the depth and accuracy of the insights derived from satellite imagery. The traditional approach provides basic visual data, while VLM datasets incorporate semantic understanding, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that would otherwise go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the remarkable aspects of VLMs is their ability to handle a wide variety of tasks. The tasks shown in the figure below range from simple image classification to more complex objectives such as environmental change detection and land use forecasting. With their integrated vision and language capabilities, VLMs can extract much more detailed and contextually relevant information from imagery than traditional models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_SAMPLE_RS_LLMS_00002.png&#34; alt=&#34;Representative tasks of Vision–Language Models in remote sensing&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Figure 2: A detailed overview of representative tasks handled by Vision–Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing. VLMs bridge the gap between visual and textual data, enabling them to perform complex multimodal tasks such as image captioning, object detection, and semantic segmentation. These models can analyze high-resolution satellite imagery while leveraging textual data like geospatial metadata, environmental descriptions, and sensor reports to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the landscape. For instance, VLMs are increasingly used in land use/land cover (LULC) classification, change detection, and disaster monitoring, offering enhanced performance over traditional methods by incorporating contextual information to reduce ambiguity. (Image source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/1/162&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MDPI&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flexibility of VLMs in handling such diverse tasks opens new possibilities in remote sensing, where the understanding of both imagery and textual data is vital for accurate analysis. The synergy between vision and language also plays a key role in making sense of complex environmental data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at the underlying architecture of VLMs, it’s clear that they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Models can either use a &lt;strong&gt;contrastive approach&lt;/strong&gt;, focusing on pairing images with descriptions, or a more &lt;strong&gt;conversational approach&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows for interactive querying of imagery. This flexibility is key for the adaptability of VLMs in real-world applications, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for immediate analysis or long-term monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_SAMPLE_RS_LLMS_00004.png&#34; alt=&#34;Architecture of contrastive and conversational Vision–Language Models&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Figure 3: A detailed breakdown of the architectures for contrastive (left) and conversational (right) Vision–Language Models (VLMs), two key paradigms that drive the integration of visual and textual data in remote sensing. The contrastive architecture utilizes a dual encoder framework where image features and textual features are independently extracted and then aligned in a common multimodal space. This design is particularly effective in tasks requiring fine-grained matching, such as image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. On the other hand, the conversational architecture builds upon the contrastive model by introducing a dialogue-based approach, enabling more dynamic interactions between the visual content and natural language queries. This makes conversational models ideal for applications like interactive mapping, question-answering systems, and real-time disaster monitoring, where context and user input are continually evolving. The figure contrasts these two architectures to highlight how they each excel in different aspects of remote sensing tasks. (Image source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/1/162&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MDPI&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This versatility in architecture makes VLMs well-suited to tackle a broad spectrum of remote sensing tasks. Whether you need to extract simple patterns or generate more detailed, context-rich analyses, the choice of model architecture significantly impacts the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, as with all machine learning models, VLMs require careful optimization to ensure they perform at their best. Enhancement techniques, like &lt;strong&gt;fine-tuning&lt;/strong&gt; certain layers and keeping others &lt;strong&gt;frozen&lt;/strong&gt;, are used to strike the right balance between model complexity and efficiency. These strategies help to refine VLMs for specific tasks, improving accuracy and minimizing computational overhead, as illustrated in the figure below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_SAMPLE_RS_LLMS_00005.png&#34; alt=&#34;Enhancement techniques in Vision–Language Models&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Figure 4: A visual representation of the various enhancement techniques employed in Vision–Language Models (VLMs) to improve their performance and accuracy in remote sensing applications. These techniques include fine-tuning and transfer learning, where pre-trained models are further optimized to adapt to specific domain tasks. The diagram showcases the interplay between frozen and fine-tuned layers, with fine-tuning denoted by the fire icon, representing the model&#39;s ability to adapt to new data, and frozen layers indicated by the snowflake icon, maintaining the stability of pre-existing knowledge. By employing these enhancement strategies, VLMs can effectively improve their ability to handle complex tasks such as LULC classification, disaster detection, and environmental monitoring, all while reducing the risk of overfitting and improving generalization to unseen datasets. (Image source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/1/162&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MDPI&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These enhancement techniques are essential for optimizing VLMs for large-scale remote sensing tasks, enabling them to extract meaningful insights from satellite imagery without becoming too computationally expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing body of research on VLMs reflects the increasing recognition of their potential in remote sensing. A recent graph shows a clear upward trend in the number of publications on the use of VLMs in this field, indicating that the scientific community is embracing these models as a valuable tool for future research and applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_SAMPLE_RS_LLMS_00003.png&#34; alt=&#34;Examples of tasks handled by Vision–Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Figure 5: A comprehensive breakdown of the various complex tasks addressed by Vision–Language Models (VLMs) in the field of remote sensing. By combining both visual data (such as satellite imagery) and textual information (like metadata, sensor reports, and geospatial documentation), VLMs are revolutionizing the way we approach tasks like image captioning, land use/land cover (LULC) classification, and change detection. The integration of these modalities allows VLMs to not only process raw visual content but also to infer meaningful insights by incorporating contextual understanding. This synergy of vision and language empowers VLMs to enhance disaster monitoring, environmental analysis, and climate change studies, offering unprecedented accuracy and interpretability in remote sensing applications. (Image source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/1/162&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MDPI&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the field of VLMs in remote sensing continues to expand, it’s clear that these models will play a pivotal role in transforming how we analyze and interpret satellite imagery, driving new innovations and methodologies in environmental monitoring and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-large-language-models-llms&#34;&gt;Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LLMs, such as GPT-4, are trained on massive corpora of text data, enabling them to grasp the intricacies of human language. However, their capacity to process sequential information isn&amp;rsquo;t limited to just text. Recent studies have shown that LLMs, when appropriately adapted, can learn to analyze non-textual data types, such as images, by incorporating their textual understanding into feature extraction processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In remote sensing, LLMs can be adapted to the following roles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Textual Contextualization&lt;/strong&gt;: LLMs can process and generate insights from external textual datasets, such as reports, maps, and metadata, which provide contextual information for satellite images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Feature Extraction&lt;/strong&gt;: By understanding the relationships between textual data and imagery, LLMs help derive semantic features that are difficult for traditional image processing algorithms to capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematically, LLMs utilize attention mechanisms, specifically the Transformer architecture, which enables them to weigh different parts of the input sequence with varying importance. This attention mechanism can be defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$Q$ represents the query (textual or image features),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$K$ represents the key (spatial or contextual attributes),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$V$ is the value (output features or attention score),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$d_k$ is the dimensionality of the key vectors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process helps in focusing on relevant parts of the data, whether it be image patches or semantic concepts, which improves classification accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;llms-in-lulc-classification&#34;&gt;LLMs in LULC Classification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification is a fundamental task in remote sensing, involving the categorization of land regions into distinct types based on satellite imagery. Traditional methods, while powerful, often overlook the contextual understanding of features that can be provided by external data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve accuracy, we employ a hybrid model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with LLMs. The CNN extracts spatial features from satellite images, while the LLM extracts contextual information from external sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of LLMs in the LULC classification process can be broken down into the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Collection&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-resolution imagery is collected from platforms like Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and THEOS, which offer multispectral and multisource data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preprocessing&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Images are corrected for atmospheric distortion and radiometrically normalized using techniques such as the Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) method to reduce atmospheric scattering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature Extraction&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNN architectures (such as ResNet-50 or EfficientNet) are applied to extract spatial features from satellite imagery. Simultaneously, large environmental corpora, such as land use reports, are processed by LLMs to extract contextual knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid Model Training&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CNN-derived spatial features and the LLM-derived contextual features are concatenated and fed into a fully connected neural network for final classification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classification and Validation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After training, the model is applied to a test set of images. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the performance. A typical validation equation for precision and recall is given as:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}, \quad \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$TP$ is the number of true positives,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$FP$ is the number of false positives,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$FN$ is the number of false negatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-study-sentinel-2-imagery-classification&#34;&gt;Case Study: Sentinel-2 Imagery Classification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the power of LLMs in enhancing LULC classification, we present a case study using Sentinel-2 imagery. Sentinel-2 provides multispectral images at a spatial resolution of up to 10 meters, allowing for detailed land cover analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-collection-and-preprocessing&#34;&gt;Data Collection and Preprocessing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentinel-2 images covering a diverse region were downloaded and preprocessed to correct atmospheric effects. Image reflectance values were normalized using the FLAASH (Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes) method to improve data consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;feature-extraction&#34;&gt;Feature Extraction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applied ResNet-50 for feature extraction from the raw satellite imagery. For contextual understanding, an LLM (such as GPT-4) was fed with environmental reports and metadata related to the region to extract textual features that provide insights into land use policies, climate conditions, and historical land usage trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hybrid-model-training&#34;&gt;Hybrid Model Training&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extracted features from both the CNN and LLM were combined into a hybrid model, trained using a multi-class cross-entropy loss function. The model achieved an accuracy improvement of 12% compared to traditional classification methods that relied solely on CNNs or SVMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges-and-future-prospects&#34;&gt;Challenges and Future Prospects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the integration of LLMs in remote sensing holds promise, several challenges remain. These include the need for large, high-quality datasets for training LLMs, the computational cost of training hybrid models, and the difficulty in obtaining ground truth data for validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research will focus on refining these models and exploring new techniques such as semi-supervised learning and transfer learning to further enhance performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continue to observe the rise of &lt;strong&gt;Vision–Language Models (VLMs)&lt;/strong&gt; in remote sensing, one notable trend is the growing body of academic work that explores their capabilities. The figure below demonstrates the increasing number of publications on VLMs in the field of remote sensing, reflecting the broad interest and potential for these models to shape the future of satellite imagery analysis.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pursuit of enhancing model performance, &lt;strong&gt;LLaVA (Large Vision-and-Language Model)&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the newer architectures that’s making waves in the remote sensing community. This innovative model is designed to seamlessly integrate both vision and language modalities, providing a rich foundation for sophisticated interpretations of satellite imagery. As illustrated below, LLaVA offers a more intuitive and interactive way of combining imagery with text, making it especially valuable in applications like land use classification, environmental monitoring, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

LLaVA enables fine-grained multimodal reasoning, allowing it to process complex datasets from diverse sources such as satellite imagery and environmental reports. By leveraging large-scale pre-trained models, LLaVA enhances performance in tasks like remote sensing and image classification through the fusion of visual cues and textual context. This approach has shown significant promise in enhancing model interpretability, particularly in applications where both visual and linguistic insights are crucial. (Image source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/1/162&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MDPI&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of many VLMs is the &lt;strong&gt;Transformer architecture&lt;/strong&gt;, which has revolutionized how models process sequences of data, whether they be text, images, or both. The transformer model&amp;rsquo;s ability to handle long-range dependencies in data has made it the backbone of cutting-edge models like GPT, BERT, and, of course, Vision Transformers (ViTs). A diagram illustrating the Transformer architecture highlights how it efficiently handles both visual and linguistic data, making it a crucial component for tasks that require understanding of complex, multimodal data sets.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_SAMPLE_RS_LLMS_00008.png&#34; alt=&#34;Illustration of Transformer architecture, a cornerstone of modern deep learning models&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Figure 8: A comprehensive illustration of the Transformer architecture, a breakthrough deep learning model that revolutionized sequence-based data processing. This architecture leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in data, which makes it highly effective in a wide range of tasks, including natural language processing and computer vision. It serves as the foundational model for Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Vision–Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vision Transformers (ViTs) are one of the latest and most powerful iterations of the Transformer model, specifically designed to handle image data. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViTs treat image patches as sequences, enabling them to capture both local and global features more effectively. The figure below offers an overview of the Vision Transformer model and its ability to process large-scale imagery data. Its application in remote sensing has shown promise, particularly for high-resolution satellite imagery classification, where understanding fine-grained patterns is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Figure 9: Detailed model overview of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a cutting-edge deep learning architecture that has transformed the way image data is processed. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViT divides an image into fixed-size patches and processes them as sequences, allowing the model to capture both local and global dependencies in an image simultaneously. This unique approach has led to impressive performance in high-resolution satellite image classification and other remote sensing tasks, making it a key model in the field of Vision–Language Models (VLMs). ViT&#39;s scalability to handle large-scale image data have made it indispensable for remote sensing applications. (Image source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929/1000&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of LLMs with traditional remote sensing techniques offers a significant improvement in the accuracy and contextual understanding of LULC classification tasks. By leveraging both spatial feature extraction from CNNs and semantic contextualization from LLMs, remote sensing models can achieve more precise and meaningful results. This approach opens new avenues for analyzing satellite imagery and provides deeper insights into Earth’s surface processes, aiding in applications ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of &lt;strong&gt;Vision–Language Models (VLMs)&lt;/strong&gt; into remote sensing is more than just a technological leap; it represents a paradigm shift in how we interpret and interact with satellite imagery. By combining the power of both visual data and linguistic context, VLMs open up new frontiers in &lt;strong&gt;land use/land cover (LULC) classification&lt;/strong&gt;, environmental monitoring, and countless other applications. The innovative capabilities of these models are not just theoretical—they are already being realized in practical, real-world scenarios, as evidenced by the growing body of research and the increasing number of publications in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results we&amp;rsquo;ve explored here demonstrate that &lt;strong&gt;VLMs&lt;/strong&gt; are not just another tool—they are a powerful bridge that connects the language of the Earth’s landscapes to the language of machine learning. With their ability to process complex multimodal data, they offer unprecedented accuracy, scalability, and efficiency in satellite data analysis. The rise of models like &lt;strong&gt;LLaVA&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Vision Transformer (ViT)&lt;/strong&gt; exemplify this potential, illustrating how cutting-edge architecture is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in &lt;strong&gt;remote sensing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes these models truly remarkable is their ability to not only analyze individual images but also to understand the nuanced context within those images. This contextual understanding is where traditional methods fall short, making &lt;strong&gt;VLMs&lt;/strong&gt; a game-changer. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s distinguishing between subtle changes in land cover, detecting environmental anomalies, or improving the precision of automated classification, these models offer a level of sophistication that will likely define the future of remote sensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we look ahead, it’s clear that &lt;strong&gt;VLMs&lt;/strong&gt; are poised to drive significant advancements in the way we monitor, understand, and protect our planet. The intersection of &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;remote sensing&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;language&lt;/strong&gt; will continue to evolve, opening doors to new research, innovations, and applications. For professionals in the field of remote sensing, the question is no longer whether to adopt &lt;strong&gt;VLMs&lt;/strong&gt;, but how soon and how deeply to integrate them into their workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we’ve explored the methodologies, models, and real-world implications of integrating &lt;strong&gt;VLMs&lt;/strong&gt; into &lt;strong&gt;remote sensing&lt;/strong&gt;. The insights from this growing area of research suggest that &lt;strong&gt;Vision–Language Models&lt;/strong&gt; will not only enhance the precision and scope of satellite data interpretation but will also unlock new levels of meaning and insight that were previously unattainable. As we continue to refine these models and expand their capabilities, the potential for &lt;strong&gt;VLMs&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;remote sensing&lt;/strong&gt; is limitless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the integration of &lt;strong&gt;Vision–Language Models&lt;/strong&gt; with remote sensing is not just an exciting trend—it is the future of how we will analyze, interpret, and leverage satellite imagery to make better decisions for our planet’s future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;albert-vs-slick-the-new-ai-fashion-at-marsail&#34;&gt;ALBERT vs SLICK: The New AI Fashion at MARSAIL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fast-evolving world of automotive insurance, precision and speed are absolutely critical. Enter &lt;strong&gt;MARSAIL&lt;/strong&gt; (Motor AI Recognition Solution Artificial Intelligence Laboratory), Thailand’s pioneering hub of automotive AI innovation. In 2025, MARSAIL proudly unveils two revolutionary models that are reshaping how car damage is detected, analyzed, and processed for insurance claims — &lt;strong&gt;ALBERT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;SLICK&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These models represent more than just technological progress; they embody a new philosophy in AI-powered insurance: a seamless synergy between &lt;strong&gt;uncompromising accuracy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;lightning-fast efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;, inspired by the teacher-student paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of this paradigm lies &lt;strong&gt;ALBERT&lt;/strong&gt;, the “teacher” — a powerhouse model meticulously engineered for razor-sharp precision. ALBERT dives deep into images, discerning the finest scratches, dents, and cracks with near-human expertise. It’s a master of detail, leaving no nuance unseen, perfect for complex offline investigations and comprehensive damage evaluations where absolute accuracy is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s fast-paced insurance ecosystem, speed is just as crucial as accuracy, particularly when it comes to frontline claim processing and on-the-spot damage assessments. This is where SLICK, the &amp;ldquo;student&amp;rdquo; model, truly shines. Guided by the advanced expertise of ALBERT, SLICK is engineered for agility and lightning-fast performance, delivering precise damage detection results in real-time. Whether running on edge devices or mobile phones, its optimized architecture allows insurance agents and repair shops to streamline their operations, making decisions faster without ever sacrificing quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent Google AI video on Knowledge Distillation: A Good Teacher is Patient and Consistent offers valuable insights into how AI models can be trained efficiently by leveraging a &amp;ldquo;teacher-student&amp;rdquo; framework. The key takeaway from this approach is that a well-trained teacher model can pass down its knowledge to a student model, significantly improving performance and generalization. This technique has sparked new ideas for MARSAIL and our work on SLICK (Selective Localization and Instance Calibration for Knowledge-Enhanced Car Damage Segmentation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same spirit of knowledge transfer, SLICK takes inspiration from the concept of &amp;ldquo;distilling&amp;rdquo; knowledge from large, complex models to create an AI system capable of precise, real-world car damage segmentation. Through components like Selective Part Segmentation, Localization-Aware Attention, and Knowledge Fusion, SLICK enhances the ability of AI models to focus on and accurately segment vehicle parts—even under challenging conditions like occlusions and deformations. Much like the patient and consistent teacher-student relationship in knowledge distillation, SLICK learns from vast datasets (including synthetic crash data and real-world insurance records) to ensure robustness and adaptability across a variety of damage scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At MARSAIL, inspired by Google AI&amp;rsquo;s knowledge distillation, we’re applying these principles to create an AI system that not only improves segmentation accuracy but also optimizes the entire automotive insurance and repair workflow. With SLICK, we are ready to bring this advanced AI to Thailand, enhancing efficiency, reducing fraud, and setting new standards for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video &amp;ldquo;Andrej Karpathy: Software Is Changing (Again)&amp;rdquo;, Karpathy discusses how artificial intelligence and deep learning are driving a new wave of transformation across industries. At MARSAIL, we deeply resonate with his perspective that AI is not just evolving—it’s fundamentally reshaping how we approach problem-solving and automation. Inspired by Karpathy’s vision, we’re applying the latest in AI research to redefine the way car damage estimation, insurance claims, and repair workflows are handled. Just as Karpathy highlights the importance of AI in software development, MARSAIL is leveraging cutting-edge AI models like SLICK to bring accuracy, speed, and efficiency to the automotive sector, helping to transform the Thai automotive insurance ecosystem into a more intelligent and scalable system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALBERT stands for &lt;em&gt;Advanced Localization and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers&lt;/em&gt;. This model is designed to be highly accurate and detailed in detecting subtle damages such as small scratches, dents, and cracks on vehicles. It leverages a vision transformer architecture enhanced with localized deformable tokens and parameter sharing to precisely focus on critical damage regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this precision comes with a computational cost. ALBERT requires powerful CUDA-enabled GPUs and is relatively slow, making it ideal for offline batch processing or scenarios where accuracy takes precedence over speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;slick-the-student-model--lightning-speed-meets-smart-knowledge&#34;&gt;SLICK: The Student Model — Lightning Speed Meets Smart Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address real-time insurance needs, MARSAIL developed &lt;strong&gt;SLICK&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;em&gt;Selective Localization and Instance Calibration with Knowledge&lt;/em&gt;. This model distills knowledge from ALBERT and integrates domain-specific insurance metadata like bumper zones and vehicle model weak points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SLICK boosts processing speed by over &lt;strong&gt;700%&lt;/strong&gt; compared to ALBERT, enabling instant damage assessments on edge devices or mobile apps without sacrificing much accuracy. Its adaptive attention mechanism dynamically calibrates segmentation proposals using contextual knowledge graphs, making it robust under varying light, weather, and occlusion conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the race to deliver the best car damage detection for insurance claims, MARSAIL takes a cutting-edge approach inspired by how humans learn: through mentorship. Our &lt;strong&gt;teacher-student model&lt;/strong&gt; architecture pairs a high-capacity “teacher” network with a lean, speedy “student” model, capturing the best of both worlds — precision and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;img/MARSAIL_TS_MODEL_01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Teacher-Student Model Concept Architecture&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Figure 3: Conceptual architecture of the MARSAIL teacher-student model (Image source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dailydoseofds.com/p/knowledge-distillation-with-teacher-assistant-for-model-compression/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Daily Dose of Data Science&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-the-teacher-student-model&#34;&gt;What is the teacher-student model?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the &lt;strong&gt;teacher&lt;/strong&gt; as a seasoned expert with a deep understanding of vehicle damage nuances — it’s large, powerful, and painstakingly precise. The &lt;strong&gt;student&lt;/strong&gt;, meanwhile, is like an apprentice: smaller, faster, and designed to perform well in real-world settings with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magic happens when the student &lt;strong&gt;learns to mimic&lt;/strong&gt; the teacher&amp;rsquo;s insights without needing to replicate its full complexity. This process is known as &lt;strong&gt;knowledge distillation&lt;/strong&gt; — where the teacher’s “soft” predictions guide the student’s training, helping it grasp subtle visual patterns that would be hard to learn from raw data alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;img/MARSAIL_TS_MODEL_02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Simple Teacher-Student Model Concept&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Figure 4: Simplified overview of the teacher-student learning framework (Image source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dailydoseofds.com/p/knowledge-distillation-with-teacher-assistant-for-model-compression/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Daily Dose of Data Science&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;measuring-size-and-efficiency-teacher-vs-student&#34;&gt;Measuring size and efficiency: teacher vs. student&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the trade-off, here’s a glimpse of the teacher and student model sizes trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The teacher is notably larger but more precise, while the student’s compact size enables rapid inference — crucial for insurance agents working on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;img/MARSAIL_TS_MODEL_03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Teacher Size (left) and Student Size (right) on CIFAR-10 dataset&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Figure 5: Visual comparison of teacher (left) and student (right) model sizes (Image source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dailydoseofds.com/p/knowledge-distillation-with-teacher-assistant-for-model-compression/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Daily Dose of Data Science&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-does-the-student-learn-from-the-teacher&#34;&gt;How does the student learn from the teacher?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training process involves the student observing both the teacher’s output and the ground truth, gradually adjusting itself to replicate the teacher’s nuanced judgments. This dual supervision accelerates the student’s learning curve, enabling it to deliver near-teacher accuracy with significantly fewer parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;img/MARSAIL_TS_MODEL_04.png&#34; alt=&#34;How to Learn from Teacher-Student&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On multiple datasets and architectures (including CNN and ResNet), MARSAIL’s teacher-student training methods consistently improved student model accuracy across the board — sometimes by over 3% compared to training without guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-does-this-matter-for-car-insurance&#34;&gt;why does this matter for car insurance?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed without compromise:&lt;/strong&gt; Insurance agents and garages need fast, reliable damage detection on smartphones or edge devices. The student model delivers rapid results, trained under the teacher’s expert supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; Smaller models reduce computational costs and power consumption, enabling scalable deployment across Thailand’s wide insurance ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robust accuracy:&lt;/strong&gt; Guided by the teacher, the student avoids common pitfalls of lightweight models, maintaining high performance even in challenging real-world conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-this-matters-for-car-insurance&#34;&gt;Why This Matters for Car Insurance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accuracy vs. Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; ALBERT excels in detailed offline analysis, perfect for complex claim investigations. SLICK offers instant, reliable damage detection to accelerate frontline claim approvals and garage estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware Flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; ALBERT demands high-end GPUs; SLICK can run efficiently on more modest, real-world devices — a game changer for field agents and repair shops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; SLICK’s use of insurance-specific metadata bridges the gap between raw image analysis and domain expertise, improving real-world applicability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mathematical-insight-simplified&#34;&gt;Mathematical Insight (Simplified)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of our system lies a sophisticated process that refines how the model understands and represents visual data at every step. Imagine ALBERT as a multi-layered brain that carefully adjusts its internal view of an image piece by piece. At each layer, it uses two powerful tools: one that lets it look broadly across different parts of the image to understand overall patterns (multi-scale self-attention), and another that processes these insights through focused, step-by-step reasoning (a multilayer perceptron).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
z^{(l+1)} = z^{(l)} + \text{MSA}(\text{LN}(z^{(l)})) + \text{MLP}(\text{LN}(z^{(l)}))
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dynamic combination helps ALBERT balance the big picture with fine details, ensuring that the model not only recognizes individual features but also how they relate to each other in context. To keep this learning smooth and stable, it applies a normalization step—similar to tuning an instrument—to make sure each layer’s output remains consistent and meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parallel to this, SLICK operates like an intelligent curator, enhancing the model’s confidence in its predictions. It does this by merging two streams of knowledge: the direct visual cues from the image itself and additional information pulled from a structured knowledge graph—think of this as a database of domain-specific facts and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
s_{mask} = \sigma(W_q [f_{img} | f_{kg}]) + b
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To blend these inputs effectively, SLICK employs a gating mechanism that acts like a smart filter or valve. This gate carefully weighs how much influence the visual data and the knowledge graph should each have in shaping the final mask quality scores. By doing so, the model doesn’t just rely on what it sees but also on what it knows about the world, leading to sharper, more reliable segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, this combination of refined visual understanding and context-aware knowledge integration lets our system adapt its focus dynamically—prioritizing regions and details that matter most for accurate damage assessment and claim processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MARSAIL, or the Motor AI Recognition Solution Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is Thailand’s pioneering AI research hub dedicated to automotive insurance and repair. Under the direction of Dr. Teerapong Panboonyuen (Dr. Kao), the lab develops deep learning models to analyze car damage, estimate repair costs, and automate claim handling — empowering insurers and garages with intelligence, precision, and speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/kaopanboonyuen/kaopanboonyuen.github.io/raw/main/files/MARS/MARSAIL.png&#34; alt=&#34;MARSAIL Logo&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Figure 1: MARSAIL logo — symbolizing excellence in automotive AI research.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey of MARSAIL began with a bold, urgent question: “Can we make car insurance in Thailand smarter, faster, and fraud-free using AI?” For decades, first-class auto insurance underwriting in Thailand has been heavily reliant on manual inspections and human judgments — prone to delays, inconsistencies, and at times, manipulation. Garage estimates for labor and parts are also far from standardized, often resulting in disputes, inefficiencies, and customer dissatisfaction. Seeing these gaps not as limitations but as opportunities, MARSAIL was born with a national mission in mind: to revolutionize Thailand’s automotive insurance ecosystem through scalable, verifiable, and explainable artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We envisioned a future where a single image of a damaged vehicle could trigger an accurate AI-driven diagnosis — identifying every dent, crack, and broken part, then instantly calculating the repair cost and parts required. This would not only expedite claims processing but also create a tamper-proof digital trail, significantly reducing fraud in the industry. At the same time, garage operators would benefit from AI-driven estimates that standardize costs and accelerate service turnaround time — allowing businesses to grow with transparency and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we didn’t stop at computer vision. We realized that to fully automate the claims process, we also needed to read and understand the documents involved — from the front of a Thai driver’s license to the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), mileage, license plate, or even the Thai National ID card of the claimant. That’s why MARSAIL also expanded into NLP and OCR research, building powerful models that combine vision and language to intelligently extract, verify, and reason over structured and unstructured vehicle-related data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is now powering what we call the “Digital Insurance Twin” — a complete AI ecosystem that mirrors and manages every car’s insurance lifecycle. For example, an insurer can use our models to approve or reject first-class coverage applications by automatically analyzing the condition of a vehicle and matching it against risk profiles. Garages can plug into our engine to generate real-time quotes validated by AI, reducing negotiation overhead and instilling transparency. For every photo and every document, there’s an AI model working behind the scenes to ensure authenticity, consistency, and fairness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of MARSAIL’s vision is not just efficiency but integrity. By minimizing human subjectivity and manual paperwork, our AI platform safeguards against inflated repairs, ghost accidents, and fraudulent identity claims. This builds long-term trust across the ecosystem: between insurers and policyholders, garages and customers, and regulators and service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we train not only car damage models but also multimodal models that fuse vision and language, including transformer-based LLMs optimized for the insurance domain. We’re teaching machines to reason with documents, anticipate inconsistencies, and provide contextual understanding — allowing for seamless automation of tasks that previously required expert-level human input. Whether it’s reading a worn-out VIN from an old pickup truck or parsing a scanned Thai ID under poor lighting, MARSAIL&amp;rsquo;s AI agents are learning, adapting, and improving with every new sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ai-driven-car-damage-estimating-global-innovations-and-marsails-vision-for-thailand&#34;&gt;AI-driven Car Damage Estimating: Global Innovations and MARSAIL&amp;rsquo;s Vision for Thailand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global automotive AI landscape is evolving rapidly, with companies like Tractable and Mitchell leading the way in using artificial intelligence to assess car damage, estimate repair costs, and streamline the claims process. For instance, Tractable’s AI photo-estimating system has already gained significant attention for its ability to analyze images of vehicle damage and provide accurate repair estimates. You can explore one of their impressive demonstrations in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example comes from Mitchell’s partnership with AI technology to enhance auto insurance workflows. This collaboration showcases the future of intelligent claims processing and damage estimation, as seen in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two AI-driven innovations are setting the stage for a new era in automotive insurance, and at MARSAIL, we aim to bring similar advancements to Thailand. Our cutting-edge AI research is designed to deliver an intelligent, scalable solution for vehicle damage estimation and claims processing. By harnessing deep learning and multimodal AI models, MARSAIL will revolutionize how car damage is assessed and how repairs are priced, ensuring transparency, reducing fraud, and optimizing the entire insurance lifecycle. Just like these global players, MARSAIL will offer a seamless, efficient, and trust-enhancing solution for the Thai automotive insurance market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us drive this transformation — not just with code and data, but with vision, integrity, and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mars-our-flagship-ai&#34;&gt;MARS: Our Flagship AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At MARSAIL’s mission lies our flagship model — MARS (Mask Attention Refinement with Sequential Quadtree Nodes). This architecture was designed with a singular goal: to perform fine-grained instance segmentation of car damage in a real-world automotive insurance setting, under various lighting, angle, and occlusion conditions. Unlike conventional approaches like Mask R-CNN or PointRend, MARS integrates hierarchical spatial reasoning using a quadtree decomposition fused with multi-level self-attention to enable both coarse-to-fine detection and spatial localization of subtle visual cues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/MARS/img/MARS_003.png&#34; alt=&#34;MARS Example Output&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Figure 2: Visual example of MARS model detecting vehicle damage areas with high precision across complex body surfaces.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core concept behind MARS draws inspiration from traditional quadtree spatial partitioning methods. Unlike standard convolutional encoders, which often struggle to preserve important structural details in large feature maps due to fixed processing limits, MARS takes a more adaptive approach. It uses a trainable system that breaks an image into regions based on how visually complex each area is. Simpler areas are processed more lightly, while more detailed or chaotic regions get extra attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
M = \sum_{i=1}^{N} g(q_i) \cdot A(q_i) \cdot F(q_i)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to what the team calls Sequential Quadtree Nodes (SQN) — a smart structure that expands only where deeper analysis is needed. Each of these nodes contributes to the overall segmentation by combining spatial focus, a confidence check, and fine-tuned local adjustments. The system selectively decides which parts of the image matter most, refining the final output by integrating all these localized insights into one coherent segmentation result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/MARS/img/featured.png&#34; alt=&#34;MARS Model Architecture&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Figure 3: MARS architecture integrates attention refinement, quadtree partitioning, and sequential mask propagation modules to enable instance-level car damage segmentation.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our experiments on Thai car damage datasets, MARS with a ResNet101-FPN backbone outperforms all existing baselines, yielding a +2.3 maskAP improvement over PointRend and +1.8 over Mask Transfiner (Panboonyuen et al. 2023). More impressively, MARS demonstrates resilience in heavily occluded scenes, where traditional architectures often over-segment or misclassify minor damages such as scratches, dents, and broken trims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond segmentation accuracy, MARS was designed with inference cost and deployment scalability in mind. The attention and SQN modules are modular and parallelizable, allowing fast inference on GPU-based edge devices commonly deployed in insurance claim centers. In practice, MARS processes a high-resolution damage image in under 180ms on an NVIDIA T4 GPU, enabling real-time integration into mobile claim apps and garage estimation tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a comprehensive explanation of the method, experimental protocol, and benchmark comparisons, readers are encouraged to refer to our full publication &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04743&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (Panboonyuen et al. 2023).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;marsail-2025-research-highlights&#34;&gt;MARSAIL 2025: Research Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we move into 2025, MARSAIL continues to push the frontier of AI for automotive insurance and repair through multimodal AI systems, low-parameter transformer architectures, and high-resolution OCR solutions tailored for real-world document processing. These efforts aim to expand our automation ecosystem beyond just car damage detection — now encompassing risk prediction, document understanding, vehicle condition analytics, and identity verification pipelines. Below we highlight three key models from our most recent research drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-albert-efficient-transformer-for-automotive-localization&#34;&gt;1. ALBERT: Efficient Transformer for Automotive Localization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALBERT (Advanced Localization and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is our compact vision transformer (ViT) tailored for car damage assessment. Unlike standard ViT and DETR-based approaches, ALBERT introduces structural inductive biases using localized deformable tokens and parameter sharing to reduce model size and memory usage while preserving high-resolution localization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematically, the ALBERT encoder layer refines input embeddings using the following formulation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
z^{(l+1)} = z^{(l)} + \text{MSA}(\text{LN}(z^{(l)})) + \text{MLP}(\text{LN}(z^{(l)}))
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where MSA is a multi-scale self-attention with learnable spatial offsets adapted to car damage priors. Through selective hard sampling and token grouping, ALBERT reduces GPU memory by 40% during training while achieving higher IoU for small scratches and localized bumper cracks. This model is ideal for mobile deployments in insurance apps and in-vehicle camera assessments (&lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10524&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;arXiv:2506.10524&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-slick-knowledge-enhanced-instance-segmentation&#34;&gt;2. SLICK: Knowledge-Enhanced Instance Segmentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SLICK (Selective Localization and Instance Calibration with Knowledge) augments vision transformer-based instance segmentation using both spatial priors and domain knowledge graphs. By integrating policy-driven insurance metadata — e.g., bumper policy zones, model-specific weak points — SLICK dynamically adjusts attention weights and segmentation proposals. This results in better prediction under diverse lighting, weather, and occlusion scenarios, especially for aging or modified vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We define a mask quality score enhanced by contextual gating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
s_{mask} = \sigma(W_q [f_{img} | f_{kg}]) + b
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SLICK delivers +2.5 maskAP improvement over MARS in high-noise scenes, setting a new benchmark in our internal Thai Vehicle Damage dataset (&lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10528&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;arXiv:2506.10528&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-dota-deformable-optimized-transformer-for-ocr&#34;&gt;3. DOTA: Deformable Optimized Transformer for OCR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOTA (Deformable Optimized Transformer Architecture) is our OCR engine designed for reading Thai ID cards, driver licenses, vehicle registration books, VIN plates, and inspection forms in real-world garage conditions. Using a retrieval-augmented architecture and deformable attention blocks, DOTA can accurately recognize text even under motion blur, glare, or partial occlusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional CRNN or standard transformer OCRs, DOTA uses a hybrid vision-language training objective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-mars-mask-attention-refinement-with-sequential-quadtree-nodes-for-car-damage-instance-segmentation&#34;&gt;4. MARS: Mask Attention Refinement with Sequential Quadtree Nodes for Car Damage Instance Segmentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;MARSAIL&lt;/strong&gt;, under the guidance of Dr. Teerapong Panboonyuen (ดร. ธีรพงศ์ ปานบุญยืน) or Dr. Kao (ดร. เก้า), our team is on a mission: to fuse cutting-edge &lt;strong&gt;vision systems&lt;/strong&gt; with real-world auto insurance workflows. Our latest work—published in Springer—introduces a dynamic way to analyze vehicle damage and process claims faster, smarter, and more precisely than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-what-sets-our-approach-apart&#34;&gt;🔍 what sets our approach apart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard image-analysis tools often struggle to keep structural details intact when dealing with complex scenes or large images. In our paper (Springer, Chapter 3), we introduce a &lt;strong&gt;hierarchical, attention-driven method&lt;/strong&gt; that adapts dynamically to the visual complexity of each region:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart partitioning&lt;/strong&gt; — the system learns to divide an image into smaller, more granular regions where details matter most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted refinement&lt;/strong&gt; — complex zones receive deeper analysis, while simpler areas are processed more lightly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sequential quadtree nodes&lt;/strong&gt; — these elements expand only in areas needing sharper focus, concentrating computing power where it counts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-how-it-works-in-practice&#34;&gt;🧠 how it works in practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each &lt;strong&gt;quadtree node&lt;/strong&gt; contributes to the final damage map by combining:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spatial focus&lt;/strong&gt; — where exactly to look,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confidence-based gating&lt;/strong&gt; — deciding &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; to trust that region,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local feature tweaks&lt;/strong&gt; — refining the outcome with sharp, situational insight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a damaged car: intricate scratches around the headlight trigger more detailed analysis, while broader, simpler zones are processed more efficiently. The combined result is a crisp and accurate segmentation mask covering the entire vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-why-it-matters-for-insurers--workshops&#34;&gt;🏎️ why it matters for insurers &amp;amp; workshops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster, smarter estimates&lt;/strong&gt; — automation tackles repetitive image tasks instantly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharper insights&lt;/strong&gt; — context-aware focus pinpoints damage with precision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficiency-driven&lt;/strong&gt; — resources are optimized for the parts of the image that matter, reducing processing load.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalable architecture&lt;/strong&gt; — adaptable from single images to massive fleets seamlessly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-conclusions--next-steps&#34;&gt;✅ conclusions &amp;amp; next steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published under the banner of &amp;ldquo;MARSAIL&amp;rdquo; in the latest Springer volume, this work signals a bold step in auto-insurance intelligence. With a pioneering lab approach and visionary leadership from Dr. Kao, MARSAIL is crafting systems that are fast, precise, and endlessly adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up next: integrating our quadtree vision engine into live insurer workflows, and testing it in real-world garages across Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By automating the entire claims process — from damage detection and cost estimation to fraud detection and reporting — MARSAIL empowers insurers with unmatched speed, accuracy, and trustworthiness. This end-to-end AI solution minimizes human error and bias, reduces processing time dramatically, and safeguards the insurance ecosystem from fraudulent activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? Faster claims, fairer settlements, and a more secure insurance future — powered entirely by intelligent automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARSAIL is not just innovating AI for automotive damage detection; we are transforming the entire insurance experience — making it smarter, safer, and more efficient. Together, we’re winning the battle against auto insurance fraud and paving the way for a better, fairer tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-work-beyond-damage--toward-full-lifecycle-intelligence&#34;&gt;Future Work: Beyond Damage – Toward Full-Lifecycle Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, our roadmap involves the development of a unified AI engine that combines damage reasoning, document verification, driving behavior analysis, and vehicle lifecycle forecasting. This would support real-time insurance pricing, repair prioritization, fraud detection, and second-hand vehicle valuation. MARSAIL is also training domain-specific large language models (LLMs) to interact with policyholders in Thai, automatically generate claim reports, and retrieve legal clauses for garage–insurance negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re collaborating with garages and insurers across Thailand to create a national automotive data lake for federated learning — enabling privacy-respecting model training across decentralized garages without centralizing sensitive vehicle data. Our ultimate goal is to support the Thai government’s vision for a Smart Nation and to make MARSAIL the Southeast Asian leader in Automotive Intelligence Infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
 --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s &lt;strong&gt;Chombueng Marathon&lt;/strong&gt; marked a special milestone for me: my &lt;strong&gt;second-ever full marathon&lt;/strong&gt;. My first was the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/blog/2022-11-22-bangkok-marathon-2022conquering-the-full-marathon/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bangkok Marathon 2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an unforgettable experience that sparked my love for the 42.195K distance. Completing that first marathon taught me the value of resilience and determination, and it’s the reason why I continue to embrace the challenge and joy of running full marathons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, it felt even more meaningful as I returned to my &lt;strong&gt;hometown, Ratchaburi&lt;/strong&gt;, to take on the challenge. Despite being born here, it wasn’t until now—at the age of 30—that I finally had the chance to run this iconic race in my own backyard. Running in my hometown for the most fun marathon of my life—42.195K finisher at the Chombueng Marathon 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Chombueng Marathon&lt;/strong&gt;, now in its &lt;strong&gt;38th year&lt;/strong&gt;, is one of Thailand’s oldest and most cherished marathons. It’s not just a race; it’s a tradition that brings together runners from across the country and beyond, while showcasing the unique charm of this small but spirited district.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to Chombueng brought back a flood of childhood memories. Growing up, I spent countless weekends visiting my mom, who worked as a teacher here. The tranquil forests, the famous &lt;strong&gt;Tham Chomphon cave&lt;/strong&gt;, the peaceful campus of &lt;strong&gt;Rajabhat University Chombueng&lt;/strong&gt;—they’ve all remained beautifully unchanged. Running through these familiar sights made the experience even more special, as if the past and present collided in the best possible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-race&#34;&gt;The Race&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;2025 Chombueng Marathon&lt;/strong&gt; was held on &lt;strong&gt;January 19th&lt;/strong&gt;, with the gun going off for the &lt;strong&gt;42.195K runners at 3:00 a.m.&lt;/strong&gt;. The weather was perfect for running, hovering between &lt;strong&gt;15–19°C&lt;/strong&gt;—cool and crisp, just the way I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off strong, clocking a &lt;strong&gt;5:39 average pace for the first 5K&lt;/strong&gt;, easing slightly to &lt;strong&gt;5:54 for the next 10K&lt;/strong&gt;. By the time I reached the halfway point at 21K, I was feeling good, finishing the first half in just over 2 hours. But as the second half began, I shifted gears to a more strategic approach: &lt;strong&gt;run-walk intervals&lt;/strong&gt;. I wanted to finish this race injury-free and with enough energy to enjoy the rest of the day—because life’s too short to spend it limping around post-race!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I crossed the finish line with a &lt;strong&gt;chip time of 5 hours and 36 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;. While it wasn’t a personal best or a sub-5, the sense of accomplishment and joy I felt was unbeatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-magic-of-chombueng&#34;&gt;The Magic of Chombueng&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What truly sets the Chombueng Marathon apart is the &lt;strong&gt;atmosphere and community spirit&lt;/strong&gt;. The entire town comes alive for this event, cheering runners on from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll always remember the &lt;strong&gt;monks sprinkling holy water&lt;/strong&gt; on us as we ran by—a uniquely Thai tradition that made me smile every time. Then there were the &lt;strong&gt;students&lt;/strong&gt;, standing by the roadside in the early hours, clapping, cheering, and offering encouragement. And, of course, the &lt;strong&gt;locals&lt;/strong&gt; who came out to support us, their smiles and shouts of &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;สู้ ๆ!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; (Keep going!) giving us the boost we needed to push through each kilometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To everyone who stood out in the cool morning air to cheer us on: &lt;strong&gt;thank you&lt;/strong&gt;. Your energy, enthusiasm, and kindness made all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaopanboonyuen/kaopanboonyuen.github.io/main/files/CBM2025_MARATHON_42KM/CB_MARATHON_011.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Chombueng Marathon 2025 Medal&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-race-atmosphere&#34;&gt;The Race Atmosphere&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s marathon was filled with joy and excitement. I met so many incredible runners, each radiating energy and enthusiasm as we gathered at the start line at 3 a.m. The crowd was electric, with smiles all around and cheers that warmed the cool morning air. The support from the spectators was truly special, and I want to give a big shoutout to two amazing women who became unexpected guides during my race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_CBM2025_V2_001.png&#34; alt=&#34;Chombueng Marathon 2025 Running Moment 1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Figure 11: A running moment during the Chombueng Marathon 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dressed in vibrant orange and blue shirts, these two seasoned runners unknowingly set the perfect pace for me during the first 15K. With their steady rhythm, I was able to maintain a comfortable &lt;strong&gt;5:50 min/km pace&lt;/strong&gt;, which kept me going without overexerting myself. Though I hadn’t trained much and had no particular strategy in mind, following them gave me the boost I needed to tackle the early stages of the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, reality hit midway—I realized that sustaining that pace for the rest of the race was beyond my current fitness level. Adjusting my strategy, I had to let go of my hopes for a &lt;strong&gt;sub-4 finish&lt;/strong&gt;, but I’m incredibly grateful to those two women for helping me start strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I crossed the finish line in 5 hours and 38 minutes. While it wasn’t the time I dreamed of, it was still a proud moment. Next time, I know &lt;strong&gt;sub-4 isn’t too far out of reach&lt;/strong&gt;. Here’s to continuing the journey and pushing myself to new limits!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-and-reflections&#34;&gt;Lessons and Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my second full marathon, and while I didn’t hit my sub-5 goal, I’m proud of what I achieved. I went into this race with very little training—my recent runs had mostly been short 5Ks. But this marathon reignited my passion for running and reminded me why I love this sport so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest lesson? It’s okay to let go of the pressure. Instead of obsessing over times and splits, I focused on enjoying the journey, listening to my body, and soaking in the experience. Running should be fun, and as long as you keep moving forward with a smile, that’s what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are more full marathons in my future. And when the next one comes around, I’ll be ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the summit was, without a doubt, the moment I had the incredible honor of presenting my work to Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a young scientist, I was deeply humbled to share my research titled &lt;em&gt;“MeViT: A Medium-Resolution Vision Transformer for Semantic Segmentation on Landsat Satellite Imagery for Agriculture in Thailand”&lt;/em&gt; with Her Royal Highness. My work focuses on addressing challenges in agricultural monitoring and resource management by leveraging cutting-edge advancements in artificial intelligence. Specifically, MeViT is designed for semantic segmentation of Landsat satellite imagery, targeting key economic crops in Thailand such as para rubber, corn, and pineapple. By enhancing Vision Transformers (ViTs) with a medium-resolution multi-branch architecture and incorporating mixed-scale convolutional feedforward networks (MixCFN), MeViT excels at extracting multi-scale local information critical for precise segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit was filled with groundbreaking talks, and one of the most memorable was the Plenary Lecture by the renowned Professor Adi Shamir. As a Turing Award Laureate and an expert in cryptography and artificial intelligence, his lecture was truly thought-provoking. The topic, &lt;em&gt;“Can you recover a deep neural network from its answers?”&lt;/em&gt;, delved into one of the most critical questions of our time—how deep learning models, which are at the forefront of AI, can be understood and potentially reverse-engineered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lecture began with a discussion on the architecture of modern neural networks, emphasizing their complexity and overparameterization. Professor Shamir explored concepts like model inversion, adversarial attacks, and the limitations of current AI systems, while raising questions about privacy-preserving AI and ethical AI frameworks. His insights on adversarial robustness and explainable AI deeply resonated with my research interests, motivating me to reflect on these critical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become indispensable in modern AI applications, with billions of dollars and countless GPU hours invested in their training. These models are often deployed as &amp;ldquo;black boxes,&amp;rdquo; allowing users to interact with them without revealing their inner workings. However, this raises a critical question: &lt;em&gt;Can the parameters of a deep neural network be recovered using only its inputs and outputs?&lt;/em&gt; In a groundbreaking plenary lecture, Turing Award recipient Prof. Adi Shamir demonstrated that for ReLU-based DNNs, it is indeed possible to recover all parameters in polynomial time relative to the number of neurons. His findings, supported by practical experiments, highlight both the potential vulnerabilities of these systems and the need for robust defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-the-basics-of-dnn-operations&#34;&gt;Understanding the Basics of DNN Operations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Shamir&amp;rsquo;s analysis lies a detailed understanding of how DNNs function. A DNN comprises multiple layers of neurons, each performing a series of linear transformations followed by non-linear activations. Among these, the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is a widely used activation function defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x).
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piecewise linear function introduces non-linearity while maintaining computational simplicity. Shamir emphasized that ReLU&amp;rsquo;s linear segments make it particularly susceptible to parameter extraction, as its outputs can be mathematically analyzed to reveal underlying weights and biases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mathematical terms, the operation of a single layer in a DNN can be expressed as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\mathbf{y} = \text{ReLU}(\mathbf{W}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}),
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\mathbf{x}$ represents the input vector,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\mathbf{W}$ is the weight matrix,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\mathbf{b}$ is the bias vector, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\mathbf{y}$ is the output vector after applying ReLU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stacking multiple such layers creates a complex mapping from inputs to outputs, making the network appear opaque to external observers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges-in-parameter-recovery&#34;&gt;Challenges in Parameter Recovery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovering the parameters of a DNN—its weights and biases—is inherently an NP-hard problem. This complexity arises from the high dimensionality of the parameter space and the limited observability of internal computations. Traditional approaches to this problem relied on exhaustive searches, which scale exponentially with the number of parameters, rendering them impractical for large networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Shamir highlighted that these challenges are exacerbated in scenarios where outputs are restricted to discrete or low-precision values. However, he proposed that by carefully designing input queries and analyzing output patterns, it is possible to significantly simplify the recovery process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;polynomial-time-parameter-extraction&#34;&gt;Polynomial Time Parameter Extraction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shamir&amp;rsquo;s key contribution lies in demonstrating a polynomial-time attack for ReLU-based DNNs. His approach leverages the inherent linearity of ReLU segments to derive equations that describe the network&amp;rsquo;s behavior. By identifying &lt;strong&gt;critical points&lt;/strong&gt;—locations where ReLU outputs switch between active and inactive states—one can extract sufficient information to reconstruct the network&amp;rsquo;s parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;critical-points-and-linear-equations&#34;&gt;Critical Points and Linear Equations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a single ReLU neuron with input $z$ and output $y = \text{ReLU}(z)$. The critical point for this neuron is $z = 0$, where the output transitions from 0 to a positive value. By probing the network with carefully chosen inputs that traverse these critical points, it becomes possible to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the active/inactive state of each neuron.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract linear equations relating the input, weights, and biases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an $n$-layer network, these equations can be combined to solve for all parameters using standard techniques from linear algebra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;practical-demonstration&#34;&gt;Practical Demonstration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a practical demonstration, Shamir applied his method to an 8-layer DNN trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This network contained 1.2 million parameters, yet all were successfully recovered in polynomial time. The experiment underscores the real-world applicability of this attack and its implications for AI security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-with-cryptographic-systems&#34;&gt;Comparison with Cryptographic Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing parallels between DNNs and cryptographic systems, Shamir likened the structure of a neural network to a block cipher, where each layer performs a distinct transformation. In cryptography, security often hinges on the infeasibility of reversing these transformations without a key. Similarly, DNNs rely on the assumption that their internal parameters cannot be deduced from external interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Shamir&amp;rsquo;s work demonstrates that this assumption does not hold for ReLU-based networks. By exploiting the deterministic nature of their operations, an adversary can effectively &amp;ldquo;decrypt&amp;rdquo; the network to reveal its parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;implications-of-randomness-and-alternative-activations&#34;&gt;Implications of Randomness and Alternative Activations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the risks posed by such attacks, Shamir explored potential defenses, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Randomness in Training and Inference&lt;/strong&gt;: Introducing stochasticity into the network&amp;rsquo;s operations, such as random noise or dropout, can obscure critical points and complicate parameter recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative Activation Functions&lt;/strong&gt;: Functions like the sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent (tanh) introduce smoother transitions, reducing the linearity exploited in Shamir&amp;rsquo;s attack. The sigmoid function, for example, is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}.
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike ReLU, sigmoid outputs are continuous and bounded, making it harder to identify critical points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;broader-implications-and-future-directions&#34;&gt;Broader Implications and Future Directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shamir&amp;rsquo;s findings have profound implications for the field of AI security. As DNNs become integral to applications ranging from healthcare to autonomous systems, ensuring their robustness against parameter extraction attacks is paramount. Future research may focus on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing architectures that are inherently resistant to such attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing formal metrics to quantify a network&amp;rsquo;s susceptibility to parameter recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploring the trade-offs between interpretability and security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Prof. Adi Shamir&amp;rsquo;s lecture sheds light on a critical vulnerability in modern AI systems while providing a roadmap for addressing it. His innovative use of cryptographic techniques underscores the interdisciplinary nature of AI research and its potential to reshape our understanding of security in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what truly stood out was the in-depth discussion I had with Professor Shamir. His monumental impact on the field of AI and his perspectives on current and future challenges was both a privilege and a learning experience that I will treasure forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a captivating lecture, Prof. Leslie Valiant delved into the concept of educability, a framework that bridges the gap between human cognitive capabilities and machine learning. Drawing inspiration from Alan Turing’s groundbreaking insights, the discussion highlighted the interplay between intelligence, learning, and the ethical design of artificial intelligence systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-foundations-of-intelligence-and-educability&#34;&gt;Historical Foundations of Intelligence and Educability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quest to define human intelligence has long been fraught with challenges. Psychologists have struggled to agree on a single definition, revealing the complexity of human cognition. Prof. Valiant proposed that much of our understanding can be reframed through the lens of &lt;strong&gt;educability&lt;/strong&gt;, which encompasses three primary facets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning from Experience&lt;/strong&gt; ($\mathcal{L}_{experience}$): The ability to generalize patterns and principles from observed phenomena.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasoning with Acquired Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; ($\mathcal{R}_{knowledge}$): Chaining learned concepts to make inferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absorbing Explicit Instruction&lt;/strong&gt; ($\mathcal{I}_{instruction}$): Gaining knowledge through direct teaching or guidance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These components have enabled humanity to progress from rudimentary tools to advanced technological civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;educability-vs-machine-learning&#34;&gt;Educability vs. Machine Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cornerstone of the lecture was the &lt;strong&gt;Church-Turing Thesis&lt;/strong&gt;, which posits that all forms of computation—whether in human brains or machines—are fundamentally equivalent. This foundational idea underpins modern efforts to replicate human cognition in artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;comparing-human-and-machine-learning&#34;&gt;Comparing Human and Machine Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current AI systems excel in pattern recognition and data-driven learning. However, they fall short in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contextual Reasoning:&lt;/strong&gt; Humans can apply learned knowledge across diverse scenarios. For example, recognizing that if $A \implies B$ and $B \implies C$, then $A \implies C$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning from Minimal Examples:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike humans, who can learn concepts from a few instances, AI often requires massive datasets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instruction-Based Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Humans thrive in environments with structured instruction, a capability that AI systems struggle to emulate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Valiant argued that replicating these nuanced aspects of educability in AI could unlock new levels of machine intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cognitive-capabilities-as-civilization-enablers&#34;&gt;Cognitive Capabilities as Civilization Enablers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human educability is unique among species, enabling the creation of advanced civilizations. This capability hinges on the ability to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generalize Across Domains:&lt;/strong&gt; Applying principles learned in one context to solve problems in another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accumulate Knowledge:&lt;/strong&gt; Building on the work of previous generations through explicit instruction and documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborate:&lt;/strong&gt; Combining cognitive efforts to achieve collective goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ethical-implications-of-ai-development&#34;&gt;Ethical Implications of AI Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Valiant emphasized the ethical considerations in designing AI systems that reflect positive human traits while avoiding the replication of human flaws. Key takeaways included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding Bias:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensuring that AI systems do not inherit societal biases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparent Decision-Making:&lt;/strong&gt; Designing AI that can explain its reasoning processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Augmenting Human Capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Building systems that complement rather than replace human intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;addressing-concerns-about-ai&#34;&gt;Addressing Concerns About AI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accountability:&lt;/strong&gt; Who is responsible for decisions made by AI systems?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety:&lt;/strong&gt; How do we ensure AI systems act in the best interest of humanity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Standards:&lt;/strong&gt; The need for international cooperation to establish ethical guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future-of-ai-and-educability&#34;&gt;The Future of AI and Educability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Valiant concluded with a vision for the future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interdisciplinary Collaboration:&lt;/strong&gt; Bringing together technologists, ethicists, and cognitive scientists to advance AI responsibly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formalizing Educability:&lt;/strong&gt; Developing mathematical models to encode human-like learning in machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human-Machine Collaboration:&lt;/strong&gt; Leveraging AI to enhance human cognitive abilities, leading to breakthroughs in science, medicine, and technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-call-to-action&#34;&gt;A Call to Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the parameters of educability is not just an academic pursuit; it is a moral imperative. By integrating insights from cognitive science, mathematics, and ethics, we can create AI systems that are not only intelligent but also aligned with human values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exploration of educability challenges us to rethink the foundations of intelligence and its implications for the future of artificial intelligence. As we navigate the complexities of AI development, let us be guided by the principles of transparency, accountability, and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;plenary-lecture-compressing-proofs-using-cryptography-prof-yael-kalai&#34;&gt;Plenary Lecture: Compressing Proofs using Cryptography (Prof Yael Kalai)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bo67m5XyVWo&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptography has always been the backbone of secure systems, enabling trust in decentralized and distributed environments. As computation scales, the demand for efficient proof systems that ensure both correctness and privacy becomes increasingly important. Succinct proofs represent a groundbreaking development in this domain, offering compact, verifiable proofs that maintain efficiency and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent lecture, &lt;strong&gt;Prof. Yael Tauman Kalai&lt;/strong&gt; presented her advancements in succinct proofs, detailing their cryptographic foundations, practical implications, and applications in areas like blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). This blog unpacks her insights and explores how these proofs address modern computational challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-succinct-proofs&#34;&gt;What Are Succinct Proofs?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Succinct proofs are cryptographic constructs designed to reduce the size and verification complexity of traditional proof systems. Instead of requiring a verifier to redo the entire computation to confirm its validity, succinct proofs enable verification with minimal computational effort. This efficiency is achieved without sacrificing security or trust, making them a critical tool for systems where scalability and privacy are paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional proof systems, which may involve large data sets and complex computations, succinct proofs achieve their compactness through advanced cryptographic techniques such as &lt;strong&gt;homomorphic encryption&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;polynomial commitments&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;elliptic curve cryptography&lt;/strong&gt;. These techniques enable a prover to encode the essential details of a computation into a small, verifiable proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-cryptographic-techniques&#34;&gt;Key Cryptographic Techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the core building blocks of succinct proofs is the concept of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). A ZKP allows a prover to convince a verifier that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond its validity. This ensures privacy while maintaining trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in a blockchain transaction, a ZKP can prove the correctness of the transaction without disclosing the sender, receiver, or amount. This is particularly critical in privacy-preserving protocols like &lt;strong&gt;zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;zk-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;zk-SNARKs&lt;/strong&gt; rely on a trusted setup to initialize the system. They use elliptic curve pairings and polynomial arithmetic to achieve their compactness. Despite their efficiency, the trusted setup requirement introduces potential vulnerabilities if compromised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;zk-STARKs&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, eliminate the need for a trusted setup by relying on hash functions and polynomial interpolation. While this makes them more transparent and secure, they often result in larger proof sizes compared to zk-SNARKs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;polynomial-commitments&#34;&gt;Polynomial Commitments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another crucial technique in succinct proofs is the use of polynomial commitments. These commitments enable the prover to encode computations as polynomials, allowing the verifier to check their correctness without directly interacting with the underlying data. Polynomial commitments are a cornerstone of many cryptographic protocols, including zk-STARKs and modern succinct proof systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;applications-of-succinct-proofs&#34;&gt;Applications of Succinct Proofs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most impactful applications of succinct proofs is in blockchain technology. Blockchains, by design, require every participant to validate transactions to maintain trust. However, as the number of transactions grows, this validation becomes a bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Succinct proofs offer a solution by enabling participants to verify the correctness of transactions without processing the full chain. Protocols like &lt;strong&gt;Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s Layer 2 solutions&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Zcash&lt;/strong&gt; leverage succinct proofs to improve scalability and maintain privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rollups&lt;/strong&gt; in Ethereum aggregate transactions off-chain and use succinct proofs to certify their correctness on-chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy-focused blockchains like Zcash use zk-SNARKs to enable shielded transactions, ensuring that details about the sender, receiver, and transaction amount remain confidential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ai-model-verification&#34;&gt;AI Model Verification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the realm of AI, succinct proofs are emerging as a tool to certify the correctness of model outputs. As AI systems grow more complex, the ability to verify their decisions becomes a challenge. Succinct proofs can be used to generate a compact, verifiable record of an AI model’s decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in image classification tasks, a succinct proof could certify that the model correctly identified an object without requiring the verifier to process the entire dataset or model. This has profound implications for AI applications in critical domains like healthcare, where trust and accountability are paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralized-identity&#34;&gt;Decentralized Identity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralized identity systems aim to give individuals control over their personal data while allowing them to prove certain attributes (e.g., age, citizenship) without revealing unnecessary details. Succinct proofs enable such systems by providing compact, privacy-preserving verifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protocols like &lt;strong&gt;Verifiable Credentials (VCs)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)&lt;/strong&gt; rely on these cryptographic techniques to ensure that identity verification is both efficient and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges-and-future-directions&#34;&gt;Challenges and Future Directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While succinct proofs offer significant advantages, they are not without challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trusted Setup&lt;/strong&gt;: zk-SNARKs require a trusted setup, which, if compromised, could undermine the security of the entire system. Research into transparent setups (as in zk-STARKs) aims to address this limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computation Overhead&lt;/strong&gt;: Although succinct proofs reduce verification complexity, the prover&amp;rsquo;s computational requirements can be high. Optimizing the proving process is an active area of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interoperability&lt;/strong&gt;: For widespread adoption, succinct proof systems must integrate seamlessly with existing technologies. This involves developing standards and protocols that ensure compatibility across platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum Resistance&lt;/strong&gt;: As quantum computing advances, many cryptographic systems, including those used in succinct proofs, face potential vulnerabilities. Developing quantum-resistant proof systems is a critical area of ongoing research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;insights-from-prof-yael-tauman-kalais-research&#34;&gt;Insights from Prof. Yael Tauman Kalai’s Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Kalai’s work pushes the boundaries of succinct proofs by exploring new cryptographic primitives and optimizing existing protocols. Her research emphasizes collaboration between academia and industry to address real-world challenges. Key areas of her focus include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;: Developing protocols that eliminate the need for trusted setups while maintaining efficiency and scalability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving Scalability&lt;/strong&gt;: Optimizing proof generation to reduce computational overhead for the prover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding Applications&lt;/strong&gt;: Applying succinct proofs to emerging fields like decentralized finance (DeFi), secure voting systems, and federated learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Succinct proofs represent a paradigm shift in cryptography, enabling efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving verification across various domains. From blockchain scalability to AI model verification, their potential applications are vast and transformative. However, realizing their full potential requires addressing challenges like computational overhead, interoperability, and quantum resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cryptographic research evolves, the collaboration between researchers, industry, and policymakers will be essential to unlock the full potential of succinct proofs. Prof. Kalai’s groundbreaking work serves as a testament to the importance of pushing the boundaries of what cryptography can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ethics-of-scientific-research-in-the-age-of-ai&#34;&gt;Ethics of Scientific Research in the Age of AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing scientific research, offering transformative tools to accelerate discovery, enhance accuracy, and expand the boundaries of human knowledge. However, these advancements also bring profound ethical challenges. At the recent panel moderated by &lt;strong&gt;Prof. Simon Chesterman&lt;/strong&gt; from the National University of Singapore, renowned experts &lt;strong&gt;Prof. Joan Rose&lt;/strong&gt; (2016 Stockholm Water Prize), &lt;strong&gt;Prof. Yael Kalai&lt;/strong&gt; (2022 ACM Prize in Computing), and &lt;strong&gt;Prof. Adi Shamir&lt;/strong&gt; (2002 Turing Award) delved into the critical ethical considerations of AI in scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;client-concerns-about-ai&#34;&gt;Client Concerns About AI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI systems increasingly shape scientific discovery, yet their application necessitates robust ethical guidelines. Governance frameworks must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define clear boundaries for AI use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address biases inherent in data and algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure transparency and accountability in AI-driven research outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;human-interaction&#34;&gt;Human Interaction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of AI into research workflows often alters the dynamic between human researchers and technology. Key considerations include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preventing over-reliance on AI outputs, which could lead to critical oversights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mitigating risks of misinterpretation of AI-generated results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balancing human intuition with machine precision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;opportunities-and-risks&#34;&gt;Opportunities and Risks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI holds immense potential to transform scientific methodologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \text{Efficiency Gain} = \frac{T_{\text{manual}}}{T_{\text{AI-assisted}}} $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where $T_{\text{manual}}$ represents the time for traditional methods and $T_{\text{AI-assisted}}$ denotes AI-accelerated approaches. While this formula underscores AI’s ability to enhance efficiency, ethical concerns include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misinformation propagation due to AI biases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job displacement for researchers whose roles are increasingly automated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;military-applications&#34;&gt;Military Applications&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI’s role in military research raises acute ethical dilemmas, particularly in autonomous weapons systems. Questions of accountability and decision-making in lethal scenarios must be urgently addressed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is accountable for errors in autonomous systems?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can ethical principles such as proportionality and necessity be encoded into AI?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;public-engagement&#34;&gt;Public Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant gap exists between the scientific community and the public’s understanding of AI. To bridge this divide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop accessible communication strategies to explain AI technologies and their implications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foster public trust through transparent disclosures of AI’s capabilities and limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;proactive-education&#34;&gt;Proactive Education&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educating researchers and policymakers is vital to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote ethical awareness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equip them to evaluate the societal impacts of their work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;accountability-and-regulation&#34;&gt;Accountability and Regulation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulating AI is a complex yet essential endeavor. Key areas of focus include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warfare Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; Establishing international norms to prohibit unethical AI use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Safety:&lt;/strong&gt; Creating standards for AI deployment in sensitive domains such as healthcare and transportation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;global-cooperation&#34;&gt;Global Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International collaboration is critical to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop shared standards for AI ethics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address cross-border challenges, such as data privacy and AI governance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;future-directions&#34;&gt;Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in research on AI risks enables policymakers to adopt informed, proactive measures rather than reactive regulations post-crisis. Proposed funding distribution can be modeled as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \text{Allocation} = \frac{R_{\text{risk}}}{R_{\text{total}}} \times 100 % $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where $R_{\text{risk}}$ represents research focused on AI risks, and $R_{\text{total}}$ is the total research budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;interdisciplinary-approach&#34;&gt;Interdisciplinary Approach&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing AI’s ethical challenges requires collaboration among:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technologists:&lt;/strong&gt; To refine AI systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethicists:&lt;/strong&gt; To integrate moral principles into AI development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policymakers:&lt;/strong&gt; To enact effective regulations and governance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel underscored that while AI offers unparalleled opportunities for scientific progress, its ethical integration requires foresight, collaboration, and accountability. By fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and committing to transparent, responsible practices, the scientific community can ensure AI serves as a force for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;visual-representation&#34;&gt;Visual Representation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mind map summarizing these insights can help readers visualize the ethical considerations of AI in scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey guys! I just completed an incredible running experience across Japan&amp;rsquo;s vibrant cities—Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo. I managed to hit sub-1-hour times while soaking in the unique vibes of each place. It was the perfect mix of pushing my pace and enjoying the sights along the way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was such a cool blend of testing my limits and discovering new places. Each run through those iconic spots felt like I was getting a real taste of Japan’s unique vibe and energy with every stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Just finished an awesome running tour through Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo! 🏃‍♂️ Nailed sub-1-hour times while soaking in all the city vibes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can&amp;#39;t believe how much fun it was to race and explore at the same time! 🇯🇵 &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/RunningExperience?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#RunningExperience&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Japan?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/Wy2bpgO8lg&#34;&gt;https://t.co/Wy2bpgO8lg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kao Panboonyuen (@kaopanboonyuen) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kaopanboonyuen/status/1838942597387362675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 25, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-1-osaka-running&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: Osaka Running&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trip marks my third time in Japan, but this time I started in the Kansai region, kicking things off in Osaka. My main goal? To conquer a city run and aim for a sub-1-hour 10K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bright and early, after a good night’s rest, I hit the streets at 4:54 AM. The weather was just right, making the run super enjoyable. I ended up covering 10.59K at a pace of 4:42, finishing in 49 minutes. Here’s the route I took:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start at Awaza&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=Awaza&amp;#43;Osaka&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Explore the route here 🗺️&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matsushima Park&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=Matsushima&amp;#43;Park&amp;#43;Osaka&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Explore the route here 📍&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chiyoza&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=Chiyoza&amp;#43;Osaka&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Explore the route here 🗺️&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minamiizuo Park&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=Minamiizuo&amp;#43;Park&amp;#43;Osaka&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Explore the route here 📍&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kitatsumorinaka Park&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=Kitatsumorinaka&amp;#43;Park&amp;#43;Osaka&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Explore the route here 🗺️&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deshirohigashi Intersection&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=Deshirohigashi&amp;#43;Intersection&amp;#43;Osaka&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Explore the route here 📍&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machida Gastroenterology Hospital&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=Machida&amp;#43;Gastroenterology&amp;#43;Hospital&amp;#43;Osaka&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Explore the route here 🗺️&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tsutenkaku Tower&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=Tsutenkaku&amp;#43;Tower&amp;#43;Osaka&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Explore the route here 📍&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finish at Matsuyamachi&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=Matsuyamachi&amp;#43;Osaka&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Explore the route here 🗺️&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nipponbashi&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=Nipponbashi&amp;#43;Osaka&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Explore the route here 📍&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Osaka is truly a city that hooks you; it’s filled with hidden gems waiting to be explored. After three action-packed days, it was time to move on to Kyoto!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-2-kyoto-running&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: Kyoto Running&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was the challenge of a sub-1-hour city run in Kyoto. I only had two days here, and luck wasn’t on my side—rain greeted me in the morning. But nothing was going to stop my determination!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crushed the city run in Kyoto, finishing 10.78K in 49 minutes (pace 4:38), which was even faster than my Osaka run! I think the rain actually helped; the air felt fresh and invigorating. Here’s my route:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrapping up my run in Kyoto felt like a major win—2 out of 3 goals achieved! Before heading to my final destination, I hopped on the Shinkansen back to Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took my first-ever Shinkansen ride from Kyoto to Tokyo, leaving at 9:39 AM and arriving at 11:54 AM. It was an absolute treat! I opted for the Green Car for that extra comfort and snagged a window seat to soak in the views. Here’s a glimpse of that journey:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-3-tokyo-running&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: Tokyo Running&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’ve made it to Tokyo! There’s always a surprise waiting here. Before my city run, a professor from Todai treated me to a swim at the Olympic pool used during the Tokyo 2020 Games. What an experience! I swam 1.2K in just 28 minutes at a pace of 2:25 per 100m. The Olympic-standard pool was incredible, and swimming alongside serious athletes was an adrenaline rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, back to the final running mission. On my second day in Tokyo, I kicked off my run at 6:52 AM. The weather was perfect—18°C with a refreshing breeze—ideal for running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;city_run_images/KAO_VO2MAX_51.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrapped up the city run covering 10.17K in 44 minutes at a pace of 4:25, marking a personal best! Here’s my route in Tokyo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-4-tokyo-farewell-run&#34;&gt;Chapter 4: Tokyo Farewell Run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before wrapping up my Tokyo adventure tomorrow, I took advantage of this morning’s cool weather, with a light drizzle setting the perfect scene for my final city run—a 5K to bid this trip a fond farewell. I covered 5.16 km in 23:54 minutes (Pace 4:38). The highlight? My VO2 Max hit a new high at 51, and Garmin labeled my training status as “Peaking.” It’s the ultimate runner’s high!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;city_run_images/KAO_PEAKING.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;city_run_images/KAO_VO2MAX_51.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my run at Nihombashihakozakicho, crossed the Eitai Bashi bridge, and continued parallel to the scenic Sumida River. Passing through the vibrant Kiyosumi-Dori Avenue at kilometer 2, I found myself immersed in Tokyo’s unique urban rhythm. I reached the serene Kiyosumi Garden by kilometer 3, before heading to Gokenborui Park at kilometer 4. The run climaxed with a sprint up Shin-Ohashi bridge, finishing at the 5K mark on the dot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;city_run_images/KAO_TOKYO_5k_001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;city_run_images/KAO_TOKYO_5k_006.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This city run was the perfect way to close out my time in Tokyo. From the calm river views to the bustling cityscape, every step was a reminder of how much this place has to offer. Until next time, Tokyo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-of-my-running-experience&#34;&gt;Summary of My Running Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Osaka Running:&lt;/strong&gt; Sub1 10.59K City Run, 49:48min, Pace 4:42&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyoto Running:&lt;/strong&gt; Sub1 10.78K City Run, 49:57min, Pace 4:38&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tokyo Running:&lt;/strong&gt; Sub1 10.17K City Run, 44:58min, Pace 4:25&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tokyo Swimming:&lt;/strong&gt; 1,200m (1.2K), 28:58min, Pace 2:25&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tokyo Running:&lt;/strong&gt; Sub24min 5.16K City Run, 23:54min, Pace 4:38&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trip to Japan was absolutely fantastic! Even though it was late summer and winter is just around the corner, running through these three major cities expanded my horizons. I encountered amazing insights into Japanese culture, met locals, and explored unseen places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait for the next experience, hopefully tackling the Tokyo Marathon (42.195K) someday! Fingers crossed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time, happy running! 🏃‍♂️🇯🇵&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    You can read our full paper on Springer here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-51023-6_3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MARS at ICIAP 2023&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;presenting-mars-mask-attention-refinement-with-sequential-quadtree-nodes-at-iciap-2023&#34;&gt;Presenting MARS: Mask Attention Refinement with Sequential Quadtree Nodes at ICIAP 2023&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;September 2023&lt;/strong&gt;, I had the privilege of presenting my latest AI research, &lt;strong&gt;MARS&lt;/strong&gt; (Mask Attention Refinement with Sequential Quadtree Nodes), at the &lt;strong&gt;International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing (ICIAP 2023)&lt;/strong&gt;, held in &lt;strong&gt;Udine, Italy&lt;/strong&gt;, from &lt;strong&gt;September 11–15&lt;/strong&gt;. MARS is a specialized deep learning model developed for &lt;strong&gt;car damage instance segmentation&lt;/strong&gt;, a vital application in the automotive insurance and garage service sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;🍄 We&amp;#39;re thrilled to unveil MARS: a groundbreaking approach utilizing Attention Refinement with Sequential Quadtree Nodes.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Paper: &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/UayUSxmZep&#34;&gt;https://t.co/UayUSxmZep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Code: &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/RoNFjSslXr&#34;&gt;https://t.co/RoNFjSslXr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/uSoBX21HpF&#34;&gt;https://t.co/uSoBX21HpF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;.&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/AI?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#AI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ComputerVision?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#ComputerVision&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeepLearning?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#DeepLearning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Research?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#Research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/oc8gz7Hs9I&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/oc8gz7Hs9I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kao Panboonyuen (@kaopanboonyuen) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kaopanboonyuen/status/1822723598764876000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;August 11, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Our model leverages &lt;strong&gt;Self-Attention Mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt; combined with &lt;strong&gt;Sequential Quadtree Nodes&lt;/strong&gt;, which together enable MARS to achieve significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines such as Mask R-CNN (ICCV 2017), PointRend (CVPR 2020), and Mask Transfiner (CVPR 2022). These improvements were validated across multiple benchmark datasets, including a large Thai car-damage dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARS was accepted at ICIAP 2023 with a competitive acceptance rate of 0.64, and our work is published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. This international recognition affirms the impact and novelty of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course! Here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;strong&gt;compelling, long-form motivation section&lt;/strong&gt; for your blog, crafted to impress readers and highlight the significance of &lt;strong&gt;MARS&lt;/strong&gt;, your mission from &lt;strong&gt;Thailand to Italy&lt;/strong&gt;, and the vision of &lt;strong&gt;MARSAIL&lt;/strong&gt; in transforming car insurance and garage automation through AI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-mars-matters-from-thailand-to-italy-building-the-future-of-automotive-ai&#34;&gt;Why MARS Matters: From Thailand to Italy, Building the Future of Automotive AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey of &lt;strong&gt;MARS&lt;/strong&gt; began not in a conference hall in Europe but in the bustling cities and garages of &lt;strong&gt;Thailand&lt;/strong&gt;, where the real-world challenges of the automotive industry sparked a vision. Every day, countless car owners and insurance agents face delays, inconsistencies, and even disputes when assessing vehicle damage. Manual inspections often rely on human judgment — which can be slow, subjective, or prone to error. In garages, mechanics struggle with non-standardized repair cost estimates. Insurers grapple with fraudulent claims, inflated repairs, and time-consuming paperwork. These challenges aren’t unique to Thailand — they’re global. But we decided to start solving them at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;MARSAIL&lt;/strong&gt; — the &lt;em&gt;Motor AI Recognition Solution Artificial Intelligence Laboratory&lt;/em&gt; — we asked ourselves: &lt;em&gt;Can we create a deep learning system that sees, understands, and evaluates vehicle damage better than a human?&lt;/em&gt; Could we develop an AI model smart enough to assist insurers, fast enough for real-time applications, and precise enough to help garage operators deliver fair, standardized repairs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe the answer is yes — and our vision for this transformation is detailed in our MARSAIL blog:
👉 &lt;a href=&#34;https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/blog/2025-07-01-marsail-the-smart-engine-behind-the-future-of-car-insurance/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARSAIL: The Smart Engine Behind the Future of Car Insurance and Intelligent Garages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer was &lt;strong&gt;MARS&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;em&gt;Mask Attention Refinement with Sequential Quadtree Nodes&lt;/em&gt; — our flagship AI architecture built from the ground up for &lt;strong&gt;car damage instance segmentation&lt;/strong&gt;. Unlike traditional models like Mask R-CNN or PointRend, which were designed for general-purpose segmentation tasks, MARS is laser-focused. It leverages &lt;strong&gt;quadtree spatial hierarchies&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;self-attention refinement&lt;/strong&gt;, and a custom transformer-based backbone to identify scratches, dents, cracks, and broken parts — even in complex lighting, occlusion, or varied car surface conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sets MARS apart is its &lt;em&gt;precision&lt;/em&gt;. It doesn’t just draw rough outlines — it &lt;em&gt;understands&lt;/em&gt; the contours of the damage. Whether it’s a shallow scratch on a bumper or a crumpled fender after a collision, MARS detects it with clarity, outperforming state-of-the-art models with a significant margin in our Thai car damage benchmarks. And this isn’t just academic — this is AI &lt;em&gt;for the real world&lt;/em&gt;, trained with real damage cases, tuned for high-stakes applications like insurance claims and repair verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when &lt;strong&gt;ICIAP 2023&lt;/strong&gt; announced their international conference in &lt;strong&gt;Udine, Italy&lt;/strong&gt;, we knew it was time to take our Thai-born innovation global. From Bangkok to Udine, we carried not just a poster and a paper — but a vision. A vision that &lt;strong&gt;AI can transform the automotive industry&lt;/strong&gt;, not by replacing people, but by empowering them: giving insurers confidence, garages clarity, and drivers trust in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presenting MARS in Italy wasn’t just a research milestone — it was a symbol of what’s possible when bold ideas are met with rigorous engineering and a passion for solving real-world problems. Our work was selected for publication in the &lt;strong&gt;Lecture Notes in Computer Science&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Springer&lt;/strong&gt;, a recognition that underscores the technical excellence and practical value of our research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;MARSAIL&lt;/strong&gt;, our mission continues. We are building an end-to-end ecosystem of automotive AI: from car damage detection to &lt;strong&gt;automated cost estimation&lt;/strong&gt;, from &lt;strong&gt;OCR document parsing&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;insurance fraud detection&lt;/strong&gt;, all powered by AI models trained with diverse Thai datasets and built to serve global standards. MARS is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because in the future we see, &lt;strong&gt;a single smartphone photo&lt;/strong&gt; is enough to initiate a car claim, verify vehicle condition, and provide a fair quote — all in seconds. This is the &lt;strong&gt;Digital Insurance Twin&lt;/strong&gt; we’re crafting. And we believe it starts with intelligence, integrity, and innovation — the core values of MARS and everything we do at MARSAIL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s drive the future — together. From Thailand to Italy, from inspiration to impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central to the design of &lt;strong&gt;MARS&lt;/strong&gt; (Mask Attention Refinement with Sequential Quadtree Nodes) lies a novel AI architecture designed to push the boundaries of &lt;strong&gt;instance segmentation&lt;/strong&gt;—specifically, for car damage detection. Traditional models like Mask R-CNN rely heavily on coarse ROI alignments and fixed spatial grids, which often result in poor mask quality for irregular or fine-grained structures like scratches, dents, or cracks. MARS overcomes this limitation through a unique &lt;strong&gt;quadtree-based spatial hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing the network to adaptively decompose images into finer patches only where needed, focusing computational attention on high-detail regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, our method integrates a &lt;strong&gt;Self-Attention Refinement Module (SARM)&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Sequential Quadtree Node Encoding&lt;/strong&gt; to build hierarchical context from coarse-to-fine levels. Instead of treating spatial locations uniformly, we recursively subdivide image regions using quadtree decomposition, capturing fine structural features with higher resolution where necessary. Let $Q = {q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n}$ denote the set of quadtree nodes generated per instance mask. Each node $q_i$ is embedded and passed through a transformer encoder, which models long-range dependencies via multi-head self-attention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\text{Attention}(Q) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QW_Q (QW_K)^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)QW_V
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These representations are aggregated to recalibrate channel-wise features dynamically, enabling MARS to predict high-fidelity instance masks with pixel-level accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, &lt;strong&gt;MARS outperforms Mask R-CNN, PointRend, and Mask Transfiner by +1.3 to +2.3 maskAP&lt;/strong&gt; on a Thai car damage dataset—demonstrating that our approach is not only theoretically elegant but also empirically superior. Our model operates on top of the &lt;strong&gt;FPN backbone (ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 variants)&lt;/strong&gt;, and benefits from a cascaded refinement pipeline that improves mask boundaries at every stage. The full details, ablation studies, and demo results are available in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kaopanboonyuen/MARS&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICIAP conference was a vibrant gathering of leading researchers and industry experts. I also had the honor to deliver a guest talk on &lt;strong&gt;modern AI advances in Large Language Models (LLMs)&lt;/strong&gt;, engaging with an international audience about cutting-edge AI trends beyond computer vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the conference wrapped up, I took the chance to travel to Rome and experience Italy’s timeless heritage. Walking through the magnificent &lt;strong&gt;St. Peter’s Basilica&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Vatican Museums&lt;/strong&gt; was a breathtaking journey into art and spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Colosseum&lt;/strong&gt;, standing proudly as an icon of ancient Roman engineering and history, was truly awe-inspiring. And of course, tossing a coin into the &lt;strong&gt;Trevi Fountain&lt;/strong&gt; was a magical moment steeped in legend — a wish for continued success in research and life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-large-language-models-llms&#34;&gt;Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) are at the forefront of a revolution in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). These models are not just sophisticated algorithms; they represent a leap forward in how machines understand and generate human language. Leveraging cutting-edge deep learning architectures, such as transformers, LLMs have transformed the landscape of language technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;We&amp;#39;re releasing a preview of OpenAI o1—a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These models can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and math. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/peKzzKX1bu&#34;&gt;https://t.co/peKzzKX1bu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; OpenAI (@OpenAI) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1834278217626317026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 12, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At their essence, LLMs are built on expansive neural networks with billions of parameters. These networks are trained on vast corpora of text data, learning to discern intricate patterns and relationships within language. Through a process known as pre-training, LLMs develop a broad understanding of linguistic structures, context, and semantics. During this phase, they utilize unsupervised learning techniques to predict masked words or sequences, refining their ability to understand and generate coherent text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following pre-training, LLMs undergo fine-tuning to adapt their general language capabilities to specific tasks or domains. This supervised learning phase involves training the model on a targeted dataset, allowing it to excel in applications such as text generation, translation, sentiment analysis, and question-answering. Techniques like transfer learning and few-shot learning further enhance the model&amp;rsquo;s adaptability, enabling it to generalize from limited examples and perform across various contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploying LLMs in real-world scenarios involves addressing practical challenges related to computational resources and scalability. These models require substantial processing power and memory, often necessitating the use of advanced hardware like GPUs or TPUs. Despite these demands, the benefits of integrating LLMs into applications—such as chatbots, virtual assistants, content generation, and automated summarization—are profound, offering significant advancements in how machines interact with human language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;architecture-of-llms&#34;&gt;Architecture of LLMs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LLMs are built on advanced architectures that often include transformer models. A transformer model utilizes self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences. The core components of a transformer are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encoder&lt;/strong&gt;: Processes the input data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;: Generates the output sequence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transformer-architecture-formula&#34;&gt;Transformer Architecture Formula&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key mathematical operation in transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which can be described as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$[ \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V ]$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$( Q )$ is the query matrix,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$( K )$ is the key matrix,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$( V )$ is the value matrix,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$( d_k )$ is the dimensionality of the keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;training-llms&#34;&gt;Training LLMs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training LLMs involves several steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;: Collect and preprocess large text corpora.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model Initialization&lt;/strong&gt;: Start with a pre-trained model or initialize from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt;: Use gradient descent and backpropagation to minimize the loss function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-llms-for-satellite-images&#34;&gt;Introduction to LLMs for Satellite Images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) like SatGPT for satellite imagery involves several critical stages. This process transforms a pre-trained model into a specialized tool capable of analyzing and generating insights from satellite images. This blog post provides a step-by-step guide to fine-tuning and deploying SatGPT, covering each phase in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their 2024 paper, &lt;em&gt;“Good at Captioning, Bad at Counting: Benchmarking GPT-4V on Earth Observation Data”&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17600&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;arXiv:2401.17600&lt;/a&gt;), Zhang and Wang focus on developing a benchmark for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) applied to Earth Observation (EO) data. Their initial framework addresses three main areas: scene understanding, localization and counting, and change detection. To assess VLM performance across these areas, they design evaluations that span various applications, from wildlife conservation to urban monitoring, as illustrated in Figure 1. Their goals are to evaluate existing VLMs, provide insights into effective prompting techniques for EO tasks, and establish a flexible system for ongoing benchmark updates and future VLM evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- 
For scene understanding, Zhang and Wang assess how VLMs integrate high-level image information with latent knowledge from language modeling. They use several datasets for this purpose: a new dataset for aerial landmark recognition to test the model’s ability to identify and geolocate U.S. landmarks, the RSICD dataset to evaluate the model’s capability to generate captions for Google Earth images, the BigEarthNet dataset to probe land cover identification in medium-resolution satellite images, and the fMoW-WILDS and PatternNet datasets to assess land use classification in high-resolution satellite images.
 --&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    The paper highlights several challenges and areas for future work. One major challenge is detecting data contamination, which is crucial for maintaining the fairness and effectiveness of benchmarks as VLMs evolve. Additionally, a more detailed analysis of model failures—such as knowledge gaps, reasoning errors, perceptual mistakes, and text misunderstandings—could provide deeper insights into current VLM capabilities. Zhang and Wang also note the static nature of benchmarks as a limitation, suggesting that dynamic updates may be necessary to keep benchmarks relevant and challenging as VLMs advance.
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;!-- 
In the domain of localization and counting, Zhang and Wang evaluate whether VLMs can extract detailed information about specific objects and understand their spatial relationships. They create datasets for this purpose, including the DIOR-RSVG dataset to test Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) abilities, where the model localizes objects based on natural language descriptions. Additionally, they use the NEON-Tree, COWC, and xBD datasets to evaluate the counting of small objects like trees, cars, and buildings in aerial and satellite images, and the aerial animal detection dataset to assess the model’s ability to count animals in tilted aerial images.

For change detection, the focus is on evaluating how VLMs track changes over time. Zhang and Wang use a dataset that categorizes buildings by damage levels and presents the data in JSON format, tracking counts before and after damage across various categories.



In the context of image captioning, Zhang and Wang evaluate the ability of instruction-following VLMs to describe aerial or satellite images. Their evaluation uses the RSICD dataset to compare VLM-generated captions with human-annotated examples both qualitatively and quantitatively, assessing how well VLMs describe images at various levels of detail.

For land use and land cover (LULC) classification, Zhang and Wang assess VLMs&#39; performance on multiple-choice classification tasks using datasets like fMoW-WILDS, PatternNet, and BigEarthNet. Their aim is to determine which models excel in zero-shot classification and how image resolution impacts classification accuracy. They find that VLM performance varies based on image resolution, label ambiguity, and granularity. Specifically, GPT-4V shows lower performance in land cover classification compared to specialized models but performs better on certain datasets like fMoW-WILDS and PatternNet. The challenges of ambiguous class labels and limited multi-spectral information in the BigEarthNet dataset also affect GPT-4V&#39;s performance.

Overall, Zhang and Wang’s work underscores the importance of evolving benchmarks and VLM capabilities to address the challenges in EO data applications.

They deliver an in-depth analysis of GPT-4V’s performance across different tasks. Figure 1 illustrates key scenarios and the model’s performance: --&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;exploring-vision-language-models-vlms-to-understand-high-level-features-in-remotely-sensed-images&#34;&gt;Exploring Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to Understand High-Level Features in Remotely Sensed Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my recent work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been diving deep into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to see how well they perform in tasks that require understanding both visual and textual data. With the explosion of AI models that can interpret images and generate coherent, detailed text, it’s become increasingly important to assess these models not just on general benchmarks, but in specific, high-stakes domains like remotely sensed imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remotely sensed images, which are collected from satellite or aerial platforms, provide a unique challenge for VLMs. They are dense with data, full of patterns, and often contain complex interactions between natural and man-made objects. The ability of a model to not only caption these images but also understand high-level features—such as differentiating between natural landmarks, infrastructure, and potential environmental changes—can have far-reaching applications in fields like agriculture, urban planning, and disaster response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt; 
  &lt;img src=&#34;Figure2.png&#34; alt=&#34;VLM Comparison for Benchmark Tasks&#34;&gt; 
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 2. A comparison of inputs and outputs from benchmark tasks using different VLMs. The snippet includes user prompts and model responses, highlighting key areas of model performance.
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17600v1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;[Good at captioning, bad at counting]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-makes-vision-language-models-vlms-special&#34;&gt;What Makes Vision-Language Models (VLMs) Special?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VLMs operate at the intersection of vision and language, giving them the ability to describe images with textual explanations. This makes them incredibly useful for analyzing and interpreting remote sensing data. In these images, VLMs can recognize patterns, identify important landmarks, and even offer insights into the features present within the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while these models excel at captioning tasks—offering detailed and sometimes creative descriptions—they can struggle with more precise tasks like counting objects or recognizing certain functional categories. This is a critical gap that must be addressed, especially in applications where accuracy is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;challenges-in-remote-sensing-with-vlms&#34;&gt;Challenges in Remote Sensing with VLMs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major challenges I’ve observed while working with VLMs on remotely sensed images is the models&amp;rsquo; difficulty in consistently recognizing high-level features, especially when dealing with complex or less common landmarks. This can lead to a high rate of refusal or incorrect identification in certain categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, a model might easily recognize a natural park or large urban feature, but struggle to identify a specific sports venue or government building. These variances are especially pronounced when analyzing remote imagery, where the perspective and scale can make recognition even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;benchmarking-vlms-on-landmark-recognition&#34;&gt;Benchmarking VLMs on Landmark Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran some experiments using five different VLMs (GPT-4V, InstructBLIP-TS-XXL, InstructBLIP-Vicuna-13b, LLaVA-v1.5, Qwen-VL-Chat) to see how well they could identify landmarks in a set of remotely sensed images. Below is the summary of the results for landmark recognition accuracy (Table 1) and refusal rate (Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;Table1and2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Table 1 and 2: Landmark Recognition Accuracy and Refusal Rate&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Table 1: Landmark recognition accuracy by functional category and Table 2: Landmark recognition refusal rate.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are significant variances in how different models perform across these categories. GPT-4V and InstructBLIP tend to outperform other models in recognizing large, prominent landmarks like natural parks and urban infrastructure. However, there’s still considerable room for improvement, especially when identifying more specific or niche features, like places of worship or government buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diving-deeper-into-vlms-case-studies-of-landmark-recognition-and-scene-interpretation&#34;&gt;Diving Deeper into VLMs: Case Studies of Landmark Recognition and Scene Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nuances of how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) understand and interpret images can be observed more clearly in specific examples. Below, I’ve analyzed a few key scenarios where GPT-4V has demonstrated both its strengths and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;visual-recognition-with-architectural-context&#34;&gt;Visual Recognition with Architectural Context&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fascinating case is GPT-4V’s ability to link visual cues with its knowledge of architecture. In &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt;, the model successfully identifies a landmark by connecting the architectural style with its vast knowledge base, arriving at the correct answer. This demonstrates its ability to use contextual clues beyond just object recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt; 
  &lt;img src=&#34;Figure3.png&#34; alt=&#34;Architectural Landmark Identification&#34;&gt; 
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 3. GPT-4V successfully corresponds visual cues with its knowledge about the architectural style of the landmark to arrive at the correct answer.
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17600v1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;[Good at captioning, bad at counting]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-problem-of-visual-misinterpretation&#34;&gt;The Problem of Visual Misinterpretation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, VLMs aren&amp;rsquo;t infallible. One case where GPT-4V struggled is in the identification of the &lt;strong&gt;Nebraska State Capitol&lt;/strong&gt;. In &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4&lt;/strong&gt;, the model incorrectly eliminates the correct answer due to misidentifying the tower-like structure. This reveals a significant gap in its ability to distinguish more subtle architectural details, leading to incorrect conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt; 
  &lt;img src=&#34;Figure4.png&#34; alt=&#34;Misidentification of Nebraska State Capitol&#34;&gt; 
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 4. GPT-4V fails to identify the tower-like structure of the Nebraska State Capitol, leading to incorrect elimination.
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17600v1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;[Good at captioning, bad at counting]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;correct-identification-but-weak-justifications&#34;&gt;Correct Identification but Weak Justifications&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, even when GPT-4V identifies a landmark correctly, it sometimes provides insufficient reasoning. In &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5&lt;/strong&gt;, the model identifies the landmark, but the reasoning lacks depth, which could be a hindrance in scenarios requiring detailed explanations, such as educational or research-oriented applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt; 
  &lt;img src=&#34;Figure5.png&#34; alt=&#34;Correct Identification but Weak Reasoning&#34;&gt; 
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 5. GPT-4V correctly identifies the landmark but gives insufficient reasoning.
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17600v1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;[Good at captioning, bad at counting]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;generating-image-captions-for-complex-scenes&#34;&gt;Generating Image Captions for Complex Scenes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting scenario is when the model is tasked with generating captions for complex images. In &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6&lt;/strong&gt;, GPT-4V generates several captions for an airport image. While the captions are coherent, they sometimes miss finer details, like the specific types of airplanes or terminal features, which could be crucial in more technical applications like surveillance or logistics planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt; 
  &lt;img src=&#34;Figure6.png&#34; alt=&#34;Airport Caption Generation&#34;&gt; 
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 6. Example captions generated for an airport image.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;object-localization-in-remote-sensing&#34;&gt;Object Localization in Remote Sensing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Object localization is another key area where VLMs need to perform exceptionally well. In &lt;strong&gt;Figure 7&lt;/strong&gt;, GPT-4V is tasked with localizing objects in a DIOR-RSVG dataset image. While it performs reasonably well, there are still challenges in precisely identifying and categorizing certain objects, especially in cluttered or low-contrast scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt; 
  &lt;img src=&#34;Figure7.png&#34; alt=&#34;Object Localization in DIOR-RSVG Dataset&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;detecting-changes-in-xview2-imagery&#34;&gt;Detecting Changes in xView2 Imagery&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in &lt;strong&gt;Figure 8&lt;/strong&gt;, the model is put to the test with change detection using the xView2 dataset, where it must identify changes in infrastructure and the environment. This kind of task is essential in applications like disaster response or urban monitoring, where rapid and accurate assessments can make a significant difference. GPT-4V’s performance is promising, but it still leaves room for improvement, especially in recognizing more subtle changes or those happening over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview-of-the-fine-tuning-process&#34;&gt;Overview of the Fine-Tuning Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPT-2 or GPT-3&lt;/strong&gt;: For generating textual descriptions or insights based on image features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vision Transformer treats images as sequences of patches and processes them with transformer architectures. The key operation in ViT involves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$[ \text{Patch Embedding}(I) = \text{Linear}(I) + \text{Positional Encoding} ]$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced models designed to understand and generate human-like text. They can be adapted for analyzing satellite imagery by combining multimodal inputs, like images and textual descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;key-equations&#34;&gt;Key Equations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying architecture for LLMs is based on the Transformer model, which is governed by:
$[
\mathbf{Z} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{QK}^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)\mathbf{V}
]$
where $\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}$ are query, key, and value matrices respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in remote sensing involves several metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, mean Average Precision (mAP), and BLEU score. These metrics help assess the quality of predictions and the relevance of generated content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;key-metrics&#34;&gt;Key Metrics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision and Recall&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision&lt;/strong&gt; measures the proportion of true positive results among all positive results predicted by the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recall&lt;/strong&gt; measures the proportion of true positive results among all actual positive results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;key-equations-7&#34;&gt;Key Equations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precision:
$[
\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
]$
Recall:
$[
\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
]$
where $TP$ is true positives, $FP$ is false positives, and $FN$ is false negatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F1 Score&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F1 Score&lt;/strong&gt; is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;key-equation&#34;&gt;Key Equation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$[
\text{F1} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
]$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mean Average Precision (mAP)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mAP&lt;/strong&gt; evaluates the precision of object detection models, averaging the precision across different recall levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;key-equation-1&#34;&gt;Key Equation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average Precision (AP) for a single class:
$[
\text{AP} = \int_{0}^{1} \text{Precision}(r) , \text{Recall}(r)
]$
where $\text{Precision}(r)$ is the precision at recall level $r$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mAP is the mean of AP across all classes:
$[
\text{mAP} = \frac{1}{C} \sum_{i=1}^{C} \text{AP}_i
]$
where $C$ is the number of classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLEU Score&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLEU Score&lt;/strong&gt; evaluates the quality of generated text by comparing it to reference texts, commonly used for tasks like image captioning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;key-equation-2&#34;&gt;Key Equation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BLEU score is calculated using n-gram precision:
$[
\text{BLEU} = \text{exp}\left(\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n \cdot \log P_n\right)
]$
where $P_n$ is the precision of n-grams, and $w_n$ is the weight for n-grams of length $n$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, large language models (LLMs) are making impressive strides in the realm of satellite data analysis, showcasing their potential across scene understanding, localization, counting, and change detection. These models are beginning to transform how we interpret complex satellite imagery, offering valuable insights for everything from environmental monitoring to urban development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these advancements, challenges remain. Current benchmarks reveal that while LLMs excel in tasks like generating descriptive captions and recognizing landmarks, they sometimes fall short in areas requiring detailed object counting and nuanced change detection. This highlights the need for more refined evaluation methods to fully capture and enhance LLM capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both satellite technology and LLMs continue to evolve, the path forward promises exciting developments. By refining benchmarks and exploring new methodologies, we can unlock even greater potential in this technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce that our paper, titled Enhanced REG-Based Object Detection of Road Assets Utilizing Generalized Focal Loss: A Case Study on Thai Highway Imagery, has been accepted for oral presentation at the 5th International Conference on Highway Engineering (iCHE 2024). This opportunity marks a significant moment in our academic journey, especially after a hiatus from international conferences since completing my Ph.D. I am eager to re-engage with the academic community and share our recent advancements in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;meet-reg-the-game-changer-in-highway-asset-detection&#34;&gt;Meet REG: The Game-Changer in Highway Asset Detection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, fellow tech enthusiasts! I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to unveil a cutting-edge innovation from my latest research—Refined Generalized Focal Loss (REG). This revolutionary approach is transforming road asset detection on Thai highways, and it’s as exciting as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the big deal with REG? Imagine a detection system that not only sees but truly understands the intricate details of highway scenes. REG pushes the boundaries of current vision-based detection models by tackling the most challenging issues: imbalanced datasets, tiny objects, and complex highway backdrops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Our paper on “Refined Generalized Focal Loss for Road Asset Detection on Thai Highways” has been accepted for oral presentation at iCHE 2024!&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Excited to share how we’re tackling road asset detection.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;📖👀 Check out the details here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/KTSGHITU7F&#34;&gt;https://t.co/KTSGHITU7F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;.&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/iCHE2024?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#iCHE2024&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/AI?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#AI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kao Panboonyuen (@kaopanboonyuen) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kaopanboonyuen/status/1832227483967746136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 7, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My work (check out Fig. 1) brings a whole new level of precision to the table. By integrating a custom loss function into the detection architecture, REG doesn&amp;rsquo;t just improve performance—it redefines it. This means sharper, more reliable detection of critical road assets like signs, lane markings, and barriers. And let’s be real, that’s a game-changer for infrastructure management and road safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt; 
&lt;img src=&#34;REG_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Refined Generalized Focal Loss Framework&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%; height: auto;&#34;&gt; 
&lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 1. The REG-based detection framework employs Generalized Focal Loss to master class imbalance in Thai highway road asset detection. Combining Transformer layers with convolutional modules, and using Batch Normalization and Adaptive Dropout, this model stands out for its robustness. It’s finely tuned to capture the unique aspects of Thai highways, focusing on rare and challenging assets. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kaopanboonyuen/REG&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;[Refined Generalized Focal Loss]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REG isn&amp;rsquo;t just a theoretical leap; it’s a practical breakthrough with real-world impact. It’s especially useful for regions with road structures similar to Thai highways, where conventional detection algorithms might falter. By merging Vision Transformers (ViT) with conditional random fields (CRF), we’ve supercharged the model’s ability to segment and identify road assets with pinpoint accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    This isn’t just about the future of intelligent transportation systems; it’s about the here and now. As we edge closer to autonomous vehicle navigation, innovations like REG are paving the way for smarter, safer roads. Buckle up and stay tuned—exciting times are ahead!
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation-and-relevance&#34;&gt;Motivation and Relevance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thailand&amp;rsquo;s highway infrastructure plays a critical role in its economic development and connectivity. However, managing and maintaining these extensive road networks presents numerous challenges, particularly in detecting and assessing road assets. Accurate identification of road features such as signs, barriers, and markings is essential for effective maintenance and safety management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    In this context, our research addresses a pressing need in highway engineering: improving road asset detection on Thai highways. Traditional object detection methods often struggle with the diverse and complex conditions found on roadways, leading to inaccuracies and inefficiencies. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a novel approach that leverages an advanced vision model with a refined Generalized Focal Loss.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our proposed method (Fig. 2) enhances the capability of REG-based object detection systems by incorporating a tailored loss function designed to address the unique characteristics of Thai highway imagery. By optimizing the detection process, our approach aims to provide more reliable and precise data for road asset management. This advancement not only contributes to the field of highway engineering but also supports the development of more efficient infrastructure management practices in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;proposed_method.png&#34; alt=&#34;Proposed Method Image&#34;&gt; &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 2. The proposed Enhanced REG-based object detection framework integrates Generalized Focal Loss for improved detection accuracy. This approach includes various REG model variants, ranging from REGn to REGx, each offering a balance between computational efficiency and detection performance. The network architecture leverages convolutional layers with Batch Normalization and Leaky ReLU activations. The Generalized Focal Loss, designed to address class imbalance, enhances performance for small and difficult-to-detect objects by focusing on hard examples. Our contribution didn’t just stop at the models; we also built our own dataset from scratch. By equipping a vehicle with high-resolution cameras, we captured detailed imagery of road assets across Thai highways. This custom dataset forms the backbone of our approach, providing a strong foundation for model training. The training utilizes the AdamW optimizer with specific hyperparameters to optimize convergence and model performance. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kaopanboonyuen/REG&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;[REG: Refined Generalized Focal Loss]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper represents a significant step forward in applying cutting-edge computer vision techniques to real-world problems. We are enthusiastic about presenting our findings at iCHE 2024 and engaging with other experts in the field to explore further innovations and collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for updates, and a big thank you to my incredible research team:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Kao_iCHE2024/kao_mars_x_iche2024_00.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;featured_full.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am, presenting our work on the Enhanced REG model and its application in detecting road assets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Kao_iCHE2024/kao_mars_x_iche2024_02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have visualizations of the detection results produced by the Enhanced REG model. The bounding boxes and labels demonstrate the model’s ability to accurately locate and classify objects. These visuals reflect the high-resolution output and the model’s performance in detecting road assets in various environments. The clarity of these results illustrates the practical utility of our model in real-time applications. It effectively showcases how our model handles complex and dynamic scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;generalized-focal-loss-for-multi-class-detection&#34;&gt;Generalized Focal Loss for Multi-Class Detection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detection task focuses on identifying seven key classes of road assets: Pavilions, Pedestrian bridges, Information signs, Single-arm poles, Bus stops, Warning signs, and Concrete guardrails (Fig. 3). The challenge lies in dealing with class imbalance — smaller and harder-to-detect objects can be easily overlooked by traditional object detection models. We address this by utilizing &lt;strong&gt;Generalized Focal Loss (GFL)&lt;/strong&gt;, which extends the classical Focal Loss to multi-class detection, giving more focus to underrepresented and challenging classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;REG_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Generalized Focal Loss for Multi-Class Detection&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 3. My proposed Generalized Focal Loss for multi-class detection tackles class imbalance across seven asset classes. By extending Focal Loss, we improve detection accuracy for small and difficult-to-classify objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;refined-generalized-focal-loss-for-segmentation&#34;&gt;Refined Generalized Focal Loss for Segmentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the segmentation task, we detect road assets at the pixel level, focusing on five classes: Pavilions, Pedestrian bridges, Information signs, Warning signs, and Concrete guardrails (Fig. 4). The key here is to ensure that every pixel is correctly classified into one of these categories, which is a non-trivial problem in cluttered highway imagery. My &lt;strong&gt;Refined Generalized Focal Loss&lt;/strong&gt; applies pixel-wise loss calculation, extending GFL into the realm of segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;REG_3.png&#34; alt=&#34;Refined Generalized Focal Loss for Segmentation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 4. The segmentation process classifies each pixel into one of five road asset classes, using Refined Generalized Focal Loss to enhance pixel-wise accuracy in segmentation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Kao_iCHE2024/kao_mars_x_iche2024_03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s look at a real-world application of our Enhanced REG model in detecting road assets. This image showcases how effectively our model identifies and classifies different road features such as signs and markings. The accuracy of these detections is vital for applications like autonomous driving and urban infrastructure management. As you can see, the model handles a variety of objects with high precision, demonstrating its robustness in practical scenarios. This performance underscores the model&amp;rsquo;s potential for real-world deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Kao_iCHE2024/kao_mars_x_iche2024_04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart presents a comparison of performance metrics between our Enhanced REG model and previous versions. We observe significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score. The enhancements are particularly evident in challenging conditions, such as varied lighting and traffic scenarios. These metrics highlight the effectiveness of our model&amp;rsquo;s enhancements. By achieving superior results, our approach sets a new benchmark in object detection accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Kao_iCHE2024/kao_mars_x_iche2024_05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this image illustrates the training process for the Enhanced REG model. It depicts the stages of optimization and fine-tuning, with various datasets and augmentation techniques used to enhance the model’s performance. The iterative process shown here is crucial for achieving the high accuracy demonstrated in our results. Observing these training phases provides insights into how we refined the model. This rigorous approach is key to ensuring the model’s effectiveness and reliability in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;refinement-term-for-spatial-contextual-learning&#34;&gt;Refinement Term for Spatial-Contextual Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further enhance learning, we introduce a spatial-contextual refinement term $(g_{i,c})$ that dynamically adjusts the loss based on the geometric and contextual significance of each object class (Fig. 5). This term allows the model to account for the spatial distribution of road assets, making it more adept at handling complex scenes typical of real-world road environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;REG_4.png&#34; alt=&#34;Spatial-Contextual Refinement Term&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 5. The refinement term \(g_{i,c}\) adjusts the loss based on spatial and contextual relevance, improving model learning in complex and cluttered road scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;joint-optimization-for-detection-and-segmentation&#34;&gt;Joint Optimization for Detection and Segmentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then integrate the detection and segmentation tasks into a joint optimization framework. By combining the losses for both tasks (Fig. 6), the model learns complementary representations, allowing it to improve both object detection and pixel-wise segmentation accuracy. This joint approach ensures that the model balances precision and recall across different road asset classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;REG_5.png&#34; alt=&#34;Joint Optimization for Detection and Segmentation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 6. Joint optimization balances detection and segmentation losses, enhancing performance across both tasks by learning complementary features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;incorporating-prediction-uncertainty&#34;&gt;Incorporating Prediction Uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further refine REG, we incorporated prediction uncertainty using a Gaussian distribution (Fig. 7). This technique accounts for the inherent noise and ambiguity in complex environments, particularly under varying lighting and cluttered backgrounds, thereby improving both robustness and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;REG_6.png&#34; alt=&#34;Incorporating Prediction Uncertainty&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 7. We model prediction uncertainty using a Gaussian distribution to handle noise and ambiguity, particularly in challenging road scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mathematical-foundations-for-optimization-in-reg&#34;&gt;Mathematical Foundations for Optimization in REG&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optimization of REG is based on advanced techniques in stochastic optimization, where we extend traditional gradient descent to operate on &lt;strong&gt;Riemannian Manifolds&lt;/strong&gt; (Fig. 8). Given the non-convex nature of the loss landscape, we utilize variational inference, proximal gradient methods, and Lagrangian multipliers, allowing for efficient optimization in multi-task learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;REG_7.png&#34; alt=&#34;Mathematical Foundations for Optimization in REG&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 8. Advanced mathematical techniques, including Riemannian stochastic gradient descent, underpin the optimization of REG in complex, high-dimensional spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;performance-analysis-for-detection-and-segmentation&#34;&gt;Performance Analysis for Detection and Segmentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we tested the model&amp;rsquo;s performance on both detection (Fig. 9) and segmentation tasks (Fig. 10). REG demonstrated significant improvements in mAP50, F1-score, and other key metrics, showcasing its capability to handle both high-overlap detection and detailed mask segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;REG_8.png&#34; alt=&#34;Detection Performance&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 9. REG outperforms other models in detection tasks, especially in high-overlap scenarios, with superior mAP50 and F1 scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;REG_9.png&#34; alt=&#34;Segmentation Performance&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this work introduces Refined Generalized Focal Loss (REG), which significantly improves the detection and segmentation of road assets in complex environments. By applying advanced mathematical techniques and integrating spatial-contextual learning, REG addresses the challenges of class imbalance and localization in highway asset detection. The mathematical insights behind this model, including optimization on Riemannian manifolds and probabilistic refinement, provide a robust framework for future improvements in vision-based infrastructure management systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;recap-a-journey-through-road-asset-detection-and-segmentation-on-thai-highways&#34;&gt;Recap: A Journey Through Road Asset Detection and Segmentation on Thai Highways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;understanding-the-scene&#34;&gt;Understanding the Scene&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re driving along a bustling Thai highway, surrounded by a landscape dotted with various road assets. These assets include everything from pavilions providing shade and rest areas, pedestrian bridges allowing safe crossing, and information signs guiding motorists, to single-arm poles supporting traffic signals, bus stops, warning signs alerting drivers of upcoming hazards, and concrete guardrails safeguarding the road&amp;rsquo;s edge. Each of these elements plays a critical role in ensuring the safety and efficiency of the highway system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-challenge-detection-and-segmentation&#34;&gt;The Challenge: Detection and Segmentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To manage and maintain these assets effectively, automated systems are employed to detect and segment these features from images captured along the highway. This process involves two main tasks: detection and segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detection Tasks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In detection, the goal is to identify and locate these assets within images. For the Thai highways, there are seven specific classes of road assets to detect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pavilions:&lt;/strong&gt; Structures offering shade and rest for travelers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pedestrian Bridges:&lt;/strong&gt; Elevated walkways ensuring safe crossing over the highway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information Signs:&lt;/strong&gt; Signs providing crucial information to drivers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Arm Poles:&lt;/strong&gt; Posts supporting traffic signals or cameras.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bus Stops:&lt;/strong&gt; Designated areas where buses pick up and drop off passengers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning Signs:&lt;/strong&gt; Signs alerting drivers to potential hazards ahead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concrete Guardrails:&lt;/strong&gt; Barriers designed to prevent vehicles from veering off the road.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Segmentation Tasks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Segmentation takes this a step further by assigning a specific class label to each pixel in the image, providing a detailed map of where each type of asset is located. For the Thai highways, the segmentation focuses on five classes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pavilions:&lt;/strong&gt; Highlighted as areas of rest and shelter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pedestrian Bridges:&lt;/strong&gt; Marked to show their location and coverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information Signs:&lt;/strong&gt; Detailed to ensure visibility and accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning Signs:&lt;/strong&gt; Identified to enhance hazard awareness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concrete Guardrails:&lt;/strong&gt; Outlined to confirm their placement along the road.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-process-in-action&#34;&gt;The Process in Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Detection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture an advanced AI system analyzing highway images. It scans each image to detect the seven classes of road assets. Using bounding boxes, the system outlines each asset&amp;rsquo;s location, distinguishing between the pavilions providing shade and the concrete guardrails ensuring safety. This detection process helps in cataloging and managing each asset efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Segmentation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to segmentation, the AI system processes the same images to create a detailed pixel-level map. Each pixel in the image is classified into one of the five categories, such as pavilions, pedestrian bridges, and warning signs. This precise classification allows for a thorough understanding of where each asset is situated, helping with tasks like maintenance scheduling and safety assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;real-world-impact&#34;&gt;Real-World Impact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dual approach—detection and segmentation—ensures that every asset along the Thai highways is accurately identified and mapped. For instance, knowing the exact location of warning signs can help in assessing their visibility and effectiveness. Similarly, detailed segmentation of concrete guardrails aids in monitoring their condition and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;paper-highlights&#34;&gt;Paper Highlights:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research addresses a critical issue in road safety: detecting key road assets such as pedestrian bridges, pavilions, signs, and concrete guardrails. We implemented an enhanced REG model integrated with &lt;strong&gt;Generalized Focal Loss&lt;/strong&gt;, which significantly improves detection accuracy, especially in complex environments with diverse lighting and backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comprehensive-analysis-of-generalized-focal-loss-and-last-layer-architectures&#34;&gt;Comprehensive Analysis of Generalized Focal Loss and Last Layer Architectures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In computer vision, both object detection and semantic segmentation are crucial tasks that leverage different approaches and final layer architectures in deep learning models. This document provides an in-depth technical overview of Generalized Focal Loss applied to both tasks, and a detailed comparison of the final layers used in each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;generalized-focal-loss-for-vision-tasks&#34;&gt;Generalized Focal Loss for Vision Tasks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generalized Focal Loss (GFL)&lt;/strong&gt; is designed to address class imbalance and focus learning on hard-to-detect objects by adjusting the standard focal loss. This approach is applicable to both detection and segmentation tasks but is formulated slightly differently for each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;
In object detection, GFL helps to improve the accuracy of detecting objects and managing class imbalance by focusing on harder-to-detect objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathematical Formula:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detection tasks involving multiple classes (e.g., Pavilions, Pedestrian Bridges, etc.), the Generalized Focal Loss is given by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{GFL}}^{\text{Detection}} = - \alpha \left(1 - p_t\right)^\gamma \log(p_t)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$p_t$ represents the predicted probability for the correct class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\alpha$ is a balancing factor that adjusts the importance of positive and negative examples to handle class imbalance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\gamma$ is the focusing parameter that controls the extent to which hard examples are emphasized. Higher values of $\gamma$ increase the focus on difficult examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    For detecting objects like Pedestrian Bridges or Concrete Guardrails, which may appear in challenging conditions, GFL reduces the weight of easy examples and enhances the learning from complex cases, such as those with partial occlusions or poor lighting.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

#### 2. Generalized Focal Loss for Segmentation Tasks

**Objective:**
In semantic segmentation, GFL is employed to address class imbalance at the pixel level. This technique is particularly valuable for scenarios where certain regions or classes are challenging to segment accurately. By focusing on these difficult regions, GFL enhances the model&#39;s performance in identifying and classifying every pixel in an image.

**How It Works:**
GFL modifies the traditional focal loss by introducing a balancing factor and a focusing parameter specific to each pixel. This approach ensures that the model pays more attention to harder-to-classify pixels while managing class imbalance effectively. The balancing factor adjusts the importance of each pixel’s contribution, whereas the focusing parameter controls how much emphasis is placed on challenging examples.

**Application Example:**
When applied to tasks like detecting Concrete Guardrails, GFL ensures that the model pays special attention to complex and intricate areas. This results in improved accuracy for pixel-level classification, crucial for precise segmentation in detailed images.

#### Differences in Final Layers: Detection vs. Segmentation

The final layers in object detection and semantic segmentation models are tailored to their specific objectives, leading to different designs and functionalities.

##### 1. Detection Layer: Bounding Box Regression and Classification

**Objective:**
In object detection, the final layer&#39;s primary task is to predict the location of objects through bounding boxes and classify each object into one of the predefined classes.

**Architecture:**

1. **Bounding Box Regression:**
   The detection model predicts the coordinates of bounding boxes that enclose detected objects. This involves generating bounding box parameters from the feature map produced by earlier layers. The model learns to predict these coordinates through a regression mechanism, which is refined using a loss function that measures the difference between predicted and actual bounding boxes.

2. **Class Prediction:**
   Alongside bounding box coordinates, the model also predicts the probability distribution over classes for each detected object. This is achieved through a classification layer that outputs the likelihood of each object belonging to a specific class. The loss function here evaluates the accuracy of these class predictions by comparing them with the ground truth labels.

##### 2. Segmentation Layer: Pixel-Level Classification

**Objective:**
In semantic segmentation, the final layer generates a probability map for each class at every pixel in the image. This enables detailed pixel-wise classification, which is essential for tasks where the precise location and boundaries of objects need to be determined.

**Architecture:**

1. **Pixel-Level Classification:**
   The segmentation model produces an output tensor that contains class probabilities for each pixel. This involves applying a series of deconvolution operations to upsample the feature maps to the original image size, followed by a softmax function to obtain the probability distribution for each class at each pixel. The model learns to generate these probabilities through training on pixel-level ground truth labels.

**Summary**

- **Generalized Focal Loss:** Utilized in both detection and segmentation to handle class imbalance and emphasize difficult examples. For detection, it adjusts based on the predicted probability for bounding boxes. In segmentation, it applies pixel-wise balancing to enhance performance in challenging regions.

- **Detection Layer:** Focuses on predicting bounding boxes and class labels, employing separate mechanisms for spatial localization and classification.

- **Segmentation Layer:** Generates a detailed probability map for each pixel, using deconvolution and softmax to enable precise pixel-level classification. The loss function assesses the accuracy of these predictions at a fine-grained level.


### Key Differences Between Detection and Segmentation Layers

1. **Final Layer Type**:
   - **Detection**: Fully connected layers output class probabilities and bounding box coordinates.
   - **Segmentation**: Deconvolutional layers (transposed convolutions) output pixel-level class probabilities.

2. **Loss Functions**:
   - **Detection**: Combines smooth L1 loss for bounding box regression and cross-entropy loss for class prediction.
   - **Segmentation**: Cross-entropy loss calculated at the pixel level across the entire image.

3. **Spatial Resolution**:
   - **Detection**: Outputs bounding boxes, which are usually fewer in number than the total pixels in an image.
   - **Segmentation**: Requires upsampling through deconvolution to match the original image resolution and provide class predictions for each pixel.

4. **Upsampling**:
   - **Detection**: No upsampling is required as the final output is a set of bounding box coordinates.
   - **Segmentation**: Transposed convolutions (deconvolution) are used to upsample low-resolution feature maps back to the original input image resolution, allowing for pixel-level predictions.

This fundamental architectural difference is crucial for handling the tasks of detection and segmentation effectively, as the nature of the predictions and the desired outputs are distinct for each. --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;explaining-the-two-samples-detection-and-segmentation&#34;&gt;Explaining the Two Samples: Detection and Segmentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detection, consider a scenario where we need to locate a Pavilion on a highway. The Generalized Focal Loss helps reduce the loss contribution from easily detected Pavilions—those that are in clear view—and shifts the model&amp;rsquo;s focus to harder cases, like Pavilions that may be partially obscured by other objects or in poor lighting. By emphasizing these challenging examples, the model improves its overall performance on diverse highway scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For segmentation, imagine the task of segmenting an Information Sign pixel by pixel. Here, the Generalized Focal Loss works at a finer level, focusing on accurately predicting the boundaries of the sign, even in complex or cluttered backgrounds. The model learns to pay more attention to pixels where it’s less confident, which results in sharper and more accurate segmentation outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dual application of the Generalized Focal Loss—both for bounding box detection and for pixel-level segmentation—enables our model to excel in both tasks, effectively handling the complexities of road asset management in real-world highway conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ### Key Metrics:
The results demonstrate our model&#39;s superior performance:
- **mAP50**: 80.340
- **mAP50-95**: 60.840
- **Precision**: 79.100
- **Recall**: 76.680
- **F1-Score**: 77.870

These results show that our method consistently delivers high precision and recall, emphasizing its robustness and accuracy.

### mAP Calculation

The mean Average Precision (mAP) is used to evaluate detection accuracy. For our model, mAP is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{mAP} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{AP}_i
$$

Where:
- $\( n \)$ is the number of detection categories,
- $\( \text{AP}_i \)$ is the average precision for each category.

### Comparison of REG Variants:

| Model    | mAP50 | mAP50-95 | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|----------|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| REGn  | 71.100| 47.760   | 80.100    | 63.460 | 70.820   |
| REGs  | 75.150| 52.070   | 82.660    | 69.950 | 75.780   |
| REGm  | 79.570| 58.060   | 85.410    | 71.290 | 77.710   |
| REGl  | 80.270| 59.110   | 82.580    | 77.220 | 79.810   |
| REGx  | 80.340| 60.840   | 79.100    | 76.680 | 77.870   |

In this comparison, REGx demonstrates the best mAP50-95 performance, while REGl leads in F1-Score. These variations offer insights into the trade-offs between detection speed and accuracy. --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the images, we’re showcasing a progression of deep learning techniques. Starting with (a) as the original input and (b) as the expected target output, we then move through different versions of REG—(c) REGn, (d) REGs, (e) REGm, (f) REGl, and (g) REGx. Now, the key point to note is that (f) and (g) highlight our proposed enhancement, where we’ve integrated a refined Generalized Focal Loss into YOLO. What’s impressive here is that you’ll see it clearly outperforms the other methods, especially in both detection (bounding boxes) and segmentation (pixel-based).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first image focuses on detection, showing the bounding box results. Meanwhile, the second image dives deeper into instance segmentation, illustrating pixel-level accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s break it down. In the first image, you&amp;rsquo;ll see how each version of REG handles object detection by drawing bounding boxes around the identified objects. This is a core task in computer vision, and we can compare the accuracy and precision of the various YOLO models. With our enhanced method using the refined Generalized Focal Loss, which we&amp;rsquo;ve integrated into REGl and REGx, you’ll notice a significant improvement in the clarity and correctness of the bounding boxes. These results indicate that our approach performs better at accurately locating objects in the images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Kao_iCHE2024/results_01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, in the second image, the focus shifts to instance segmentation, where instead of just detecting objects with boxes, we’re identifying the exact pixel regions for each object. This is a more complex task that requires higher precision. Here again, our enhanced REG models stand out. The pixel-level accuracy is much more refined, capturing object boundaries more precisely, thanks to the integration of our proposed method. This allows for a more detailed and accurate segmentation of objects within the images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Kao_iCHE2024/results_02.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, our proposed enhancements to the REG model—through the integration of refined Generalized Focal Loss—deliver significant improvements in both object detection and instance segmentation. The results across both images clearly demonstrate that our approach excels at accurately detecting and precisely segmenting objects. Whether it’s drawing clean bounding boxes or defining exact pixel regions, our method proves to be the clear winner. This shows that refining loss functions can have a big impact on model performance, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with deep learning in computer vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our paper, &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Refined Generalized Focal Loss for Road Asset Detection on Thai Highways Using Vision-Based Detection and Segmentation Models&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;, we explore advancements in object detection and segmentation models tailored for detecting road assets on Thai highways. These assets include a variety of elements crucial for road safety and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;generalized-focal-loss-for-detection-tasks&#34;&gt;Generalized Focal Loss for Detection Tasks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generalized Focal Loss (GFL) is an enhancement over traditional focal loss, which aims to address class imbalance by focusing more on hard-to-detect objects. It introduces a dynamic focal weight that is adaptive to different classes, improving detection performance in complex scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;key-equation-for-detection&#34;&gt;Key Equation for Detection&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Generalized Focal Loss is formulated as:
$[
\text{GFL}_{\text{det}} = - \frac{1 - \text{p}_i^{\gamma}}{1 - \text{p}_i} \cdot \text{log}(\text{p}_i)
]$
where $\text{p}_i$ is the predicted probability for the $i$-th class, and $\gamma$ is the focusing parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;generalized-focal-loss-for-segmentation-tasks&#34;&gt;Generalized Focal Loss for Segmentation Tasks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For segmentation tasks, GFL adapts by focusing on pixel-wise predictions, enhancing the model&amp;rsquo;s ability to handle imbalanced data and challenging regions within the images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- #### Key Equation for Segmentation
The Generalized Focal Loss for segmentation is:
$\[
\text{GFL}_{\text{seg}} = - \frac{(1 - \text{p}_{i,j}^{\gamma})}{(1 - \text{p}_{i,j})} \cdot \text{log}(\text{p}_{i,j})
\]$
where $\text{p}_{i,j}$ represents the predicted probability for pixel $(i, j)$. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary difference in the loss functions for detection and segmentation tasks is how they handle spatial versus class-level data. Detection models often deal with bounding boxes and class predictions, while segmentation models handle pixel-wise classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- #### Detection vs. Segmentation Loss Formula
For detection:
$\[
\text{Loss}_{\text{det}} = \text{GFL}_{\text{det}} + \text{Reg}_{\text{det}}
\]$
where $\text{Reg}_{\text{det}}$ is the regression loss for bounding box coordinates.

For segmentation:
$\[
\text{Loss}_{\text{seg}} = \text{GFL}_{\text{seg}} + \text{Dice}_{\text{seg}}
\]$
where $\text{Dice}_{\text{seg}}$ is the Dice coefficient for measuring overlap between predicted and ground truth masks. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimization in object detection and segmentation models involves tuning hyperparameters and adjusting learning rates to improve convergence and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- #### Key Equation for Optimization
The optimization objective often involves minimizing the combined loss function:
$\[
\text{Loss}_{\text{total}} = \lambda_1 \cdot \text{Loss}_{\text{det}} + \lambda_2 \cdot \text{Loss}_{\text{seg}}
\]$
where $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are weight parameters that balance the contributions of detection and segmentation losses. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the following formulas is crucial for implementing and refining GFL in detection and segmentation tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Softmax Function&lt;/strong&gt;:
$[
\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}}
]$
where $z_i$ is the score for class $i$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Entropy Loss&lt;/strong&gt;:
$[
\text{CrossEntropy}(y, \hat{y}) = - \sum_{i} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)
]$
where $y_i$ is the ground truth and $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dice Coefficient&lt;/strong&gt;:
$[
\text{Dice} = \frac{2 |A \cap B|}{|A| + |B|}
]$
where $A$ and $B$ are the predicted and true segmentation masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our paper will undergo a &lt;strong&gt;fast-track formal review process&lt;/strong&gt; for potential publication in the &lt;strong&gt;Transportmetrica A journal&lt;/strong&gt;. We’re optimistic that this research will significantly contribute to highway engineering and road asset management fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teerapong Panboonyuen (ธีรพงศ์ ปานบุญยืน)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but you can call me Kao (เก้า).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this space, I’m excited to share the highs and lows of my AI journey, how I juggle between academic and industry work, and the coolest trends shaking up the AI world. Stick around and dive into the world of AI with me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-journey-into-ai-research&#34;&gt;My Journey into AI Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got into AI back when I was doing my Master’s at Chulalongkorn University. The challenges and possibilities in AI were just too exciting to ignore. By 24, I had my Master’s under my belt, and by 27, I was rocking a Ph.D. Since then, I’ve been diving deep into AI research, especially in areas like Remote Sensing and Computer Vision. I’m all about the hardcore math behind AI—like optimization and statistical learning. My big goal? Using AI to solve real-world problems and make the world a better place. If you want to see what I’m working on, check out my profile here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;kaopanboonyuen.github.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring the Life of an AI Research Scientist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of AI research, every day is a blend of cutting-edge exploration and meticulous analysis. As an AI research scientist, your life revolves around decoding complex algorithms, fine-tuning models, and pushing the boundaries of what artificial intelligence can achieve. The journey typically involves diving into vast datasets, developing and experimenting with sophisticated neural networks, and translating theoretical concepts into practical, real-world applications. The thrill of seeing a new model perform exceptionally well or uncovering a novel insight drives the passion in this field. Collaboration with peers and staying abreast of the latest advancements is crucial, making continuous learning an integral part of the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transforming Research with Gemini and Modern LLMs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landscape of AI research is undergoing a significant transformation with the advent of advanced large language models (LLMs) like Gemini. These cutting-edge tools are revolutionizing how researchers approach their work, enabling more efficient data processing and deeper insights.

&lt;p&gt;Curious to know more about my work and adventures? Check out my profile here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;kaopanboonyuen.github.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;featured_vertical.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;balancing-academia-and-industry&#34;&gt;Balancing Academia and Industry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I juggle both academic and industrial roles? The answer lies in the different kinds of excitement each provides. In academia, I&amp;rsquo;m drawn to the elegance and complexity of theoretical work—understanding AI at its core and pushing its boundaries. On the other hand, the industrial side offers the thrill of seeing AI solutions deployed in real-world applications, making a tangible impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    I firmly believe that combining both worlds enriches my research. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly fulfilling to publish groundbreaking work and even more exhilarating when that research translates into practical solutions that benefit society. This dual approach keeps me grounded in the realities of implementation while allowing me to explore theoretical possibilities.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-qualities-for-ideal-ai-agents&#34;&gt;Key Qualities for Ideal AI Agents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal characteristics (Fig. 2) envisioned for AI agents are numerous, each presenting its own significant research challenge before even considering the automatic acquisition of these traits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning to learn&lt;/strong&gt;: The ability to enhance its learning process over time [2]–[8].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifelong learning&lt;/strong&gt;: Engaging in continual and incremental learning throughout its existence [9]–[13].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gradual knowledge and skill accumulation&lt;/strong&gt;: Building up knowledge and abilities progressively, layer by layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reuse of learned knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;: Applying previously acquired skills to discover and learn new ones, incorporating both forward and backward knowledge transfer [10].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open-ended exploration&lt;/strong&gt;: The capability to explore without predefined boundaries [14], [15] and to set its own self-invented goals for learning [16]–[20].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out-of-distribution generalization&lt;/strong&gt;: Extending its learning capabilities to new and previously unseen problems [21]–[24] and making logical extrapolations beyond its initial training data [25], [26].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;ai_topic_01.png&#34; alt=&#34;TA Badger &#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 1. TA Badger agent is trained with bi-level optimization, involving two loops: the outer loop, which focuses on lifelong learning and other requirements, and the inner loop, where the agent undergoes extensive training on various curricula to develop skills approaching human-level proficiency. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodai.com/goodai-research-roadmap-2021-2022/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Goodai-Research-Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;featured.png&#34; alt=&#34;Kao&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&#34;font-style: italic; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Fig. 2. I had the chance to dive into &#34;Career Paths for AI Research Scientists: My Journey and Insights&#34; during a talk at Sirindhorn Science Home (SSH). It was a great opportunity to share my experiences and offer some tips on navigating the exciting world of AI research. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nstda.or.th/ssh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sirindhorn Science Home (SSH)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various strategies to develop agents with these properties. At GoodAI, they have converged on foundational principles such as the modularity of agents, a shared policy across modules with varying internal states, and a blend of meta-learning in the outer loop followed by open-ended learning in the inner loop. These principles are central to their Badger architectures and will be discussed further in the section &amp;ldquo;Towards Implementation.&amp;rdquo; It is essential to highlight that these desired properties should manifest during the agent&amp;rsquo;s operational phase, specifically in the inner loop (the agent’s lifetime). They often utilize a meta-learning approach, which involves a bi-level optimization process where optimization occurs at two levels [4], [27], [28]. This meta-learning framework is considered the default setting throughout this discussion unless otherwise noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cool-factor-in-research&#34;&gt;The Cool Factor in Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key motivators for any researcher is the &amp;ldquo;cool factor&amp;rdquo;—that sense of excitement when working on something groundbreaking. For me, that thrill comes from applying AI to satellite imagery for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) analysis in agriculture. The very idea of using AI to derive insights from images captured from space is inherently fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Imagine using AI to assist in medical diagnostics. For instance, developing an AI model that can detect polyps or tumors during a colonoscopy more accurately than current state-of-the-art methods. Not only is this research cool, but it also has a profound impact—it can save lives. AI might not yet match human experts in every scenario, but as an early detection tool, its potential is undeniable.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-the-three-types-of-artificial-intelligence&#34;&gt;Understanding the Three Types of Artificial Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those pursuing a career as AI research scientists, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to understand the different categories of AI based on their capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrow AI (Weak AI or ANI):&lt;/strong&gt; Narrow AI is specialized in performing specific tasks. It is designed with a narrow focus and cannot operate outside its pre-defined capabilities. Research in this area involves developing and fine-tuning algorithms to perform specialized tasks efficiently, such as facial recognition, language translation, and recommendation systems. Career opportunities here include roles like AI specialist, data scientist, and machine learning engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General AI (Strong AI or AGI):&lt;/strong&gt; General AI aims to mirror human cognitive abilities, enabling it to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks. Working in this field requires a deep understanding of various AI and machine learning techniques, and researchers often focus on creating systems that can think and reason like humans. Careers in this area might involve research positions in advanced AI labs, academia, or tech companies that are pioneering AGI development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):&lt;/strong&gt; ASI represents the pinnacle of AI development, where machines would surpass human intelligence across all domains. Research here is still theoretical but involves exploring concepts that could eventually lead to machines with superior cognitive abilities. Professionals focusing on ASI are usually involved in speculative research, ethical considerations, and futuristic technology development. Career paths might include roles as AI ethicists, theoretical AI researchers, or innovators at cutting-edge research institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these AI types (Fig. 2) can guide aspiring AI researchers in choosing the right focus area for their careers, whether it&amp;rsquo;s enhancing specialized AI applications or contributing to the quest for creating truly intelligent machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-trends-in-ai-research&#34;&gt;Key Trends in AI Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of AI is constantly evolving, with several exciting trends emerging. Here&amp;rsquo;s a look at some of the most promising areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative AI&lt;/strong&gt;: With models like GANs and diffusion models, generative AI is revolutionizing how we create content, from art and music to realistic simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Supervised Learning&lt;/strong&gt;: This approach is gaining traction as it reduces the need for labeled data, making it easier to train AI models on vast datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;inspiration-for-aspiring-researchers&#34;&gt;Inspiration for Aspiring Researchers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those considering a career in AI research, my advice is simple: find a topic that excites you. Choose projects that you find inherently cool. This passion will sustain you through the challenges of research. Start by exploring current literature to understand what has already been done and identify gaps. Decide whether to build on existing models or innovate from scratch. Focus on how you can improve accuracy, speed, or applicability of AI solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, research is a journey, not a destination. Be curious, be patient, and never stop learning. The most rewarding part of research is not just the recognition that comes from publishing a paper but seeing your work make a real-world impact. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s through advancing technology or improving lives, your contribution as a researcher can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 26, 1995, Bill Gates wrote the influential “Internet Tidal Wave” memo at Microsoft, which marked a major shift for the company towards the emerging World Wide Web. This moment was reminiscent of a recent analogy from HubSpot CTO Dharmesh Shah, who compared Netscape&amp;rsquo;s impact on the Internet to ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s influence on AI. Just as Netscape made the Internet accessible, ChatGPT is reshaping our understanding of AI, though its full effects on work and creativity remain uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, now a major supporter of OpenAI (the creator of ChatGPT), is again at the forefront of this change, potentially challenging Google Search with ChatGPT integration into Bing. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers likened AI to a &amp;ldquo;caddie&amp;rdquo; that enhances our creativity and accuracy, though he cautioned against over-reliance on AI, which could lead to uniform and uninspired results. Summers also highlighted AI&amp;rsquo;s potential as a transformative technology, comparable to the printing press or electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-trends-in-generative-ai&#34;&gt;Key Trends in Generative AI&lt;/h2&gt;

The integration of generative AI in various fields, from art to science, will likely lead to groundbreaking innovations and transformative experiences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
Here is a simple Python code snippet demonstrating the basic structure of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;diffusion-model-implementation-with-gaussian-diffusion&#34;&gt;Diffusion Model Implementation with Gaussian Diffusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code demonstrates the implementation of a diffusion model using a U-Net-like architecture combined with a Gaussian diffusion process. The model consists of two primary classes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DiffusionModel Class&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: Constructs an autoencoder architecture for processing and reconstructing images. The encoder extracts features from input images, while the decoder reconstructs the images from these features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structure&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encoder&lt;/strong&gt;: A series of convolutional layers that reduce spatial dimensions and increase feature channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;: A series of transposed convolutional layers that upsample feature maps to the original image size. Uses Tanh activation in the final layer to ensure pixel values are in the range of [-1, 1].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GaussianDiffusion Class&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: Implements the Gaussian diffusion process, which includes both the forward (adding noise) and reverse (removing noise) diffusion steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Components&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beta Schedule&lt;/strong&gt;: Linearly increases noise levels over timesteps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forward Diffusion Sample&lt;/strong&gt;: Adds noise to the input image according to the current timestep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverse Diffusion Step&lt;/strong&gt;: Uses the trained model to predict and remove noise from the image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forward Method&lt;/strong&gt;: Executes the reverse diffusion process over all timesteps to reconstruct the image from noisy data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;diffusion-sample-usage&#34;&gt;Diffusion Sample Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example demonstrates how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialize the &lt;code&gt;DiffusionModel&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GaussianDiffusion&lt;/code&gt; classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a dummy image tensor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform forward diffusion to add noise and reverse diffusion to reconstruct the image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code also includes a print statement to verify the shape of the reconstructed image, ensuring it matches the expected dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    This setup provides a foundational framework for experimenting with diffusion models and can be adapted for various image processing and generation tasks.

# ## Diffusion Models
#
# Diffusion models are a cutting-edge approach in generative AI, particularly effective for image generation and editing tasks. They work by iteratively denoising data to recover the original distribution. The key concept is to reverse a diffusion process where noise is added and then removed to reconstruct the original data.
#
# The core objective function for diffusion models can be expressed as follows:
#
# C(x) = -1 / (σ √(2π)) * ((x - μ) / σ)² * exp(-0.5 * ((x - μ) / σ)²)
#
# Where:
# - x is the data point.
# - μ is the mean of the data distribution.
# - σ is the standard deviation of the data distribution.
#
# Another formulation for the objective function is:
#
# L(x) = 0.5 * ((x - μ) / σ)² + 0.5 * log(2πσ²)
#
# Here:
# - 0.5 * ((x - μ) / σ)² represents the squared deviation from the mean, which measures the distance between generated and target distributions.
# - 0.5 * log(2πσ²) represents the entropy term that accounts for the normalization factor in the Gaussian distribution.
#
# In a more general form, related to a stochastic process:
#
# L(x) = E[0.5 * ||x - μ||² + 0.5 * log(2πσ²)]
#
# Where E denotes the expectation over the diffusion process, capturing the average cost of deviation.
#
# This objective function measures how well the model can reverse the diffusion process, minimizing the discrepancy between the true noise and the predicted noise.
#
# Modern diffusion models, such as those used in DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion, leverage extensive training on diverse datasets and incorporate additional conditioning information to enable precise control over generated images.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;diffusion-models&#34;&gt;Diffusion Models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach in generative AI, especially for tasks involving image generation and editing. These models iteratively denoise images to recover the original data distribution. The objective function for diffusion models can be expressed as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
C(x) = -\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2 e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}
$$
&lt;code&gt;Where:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$x$ represents the data point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\mu$ represents the mean of the data distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\sigma$ represents the standard deviation of the data distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
L(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{2} \log(2 \pi \sigma^2)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \right)^2 )$ represents the squared deviation from the mean, often used in diffusion models to measure the distance between generated and target distributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$( \frac{1}{2} \log(2 \pi \sigma^2) )$ represents the entropy term, which accounts for the normalization factor in the Gaussian distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also represent the diffusion objective function in a more general form related to a stochastic process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
L(x) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{1}{2} | x - \mu |^2 + \frac{1}{2} \log(2 \pi \sigma^2) \right]
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, $( \mathbb{E} )$ denotes the expectation over the diffusion process, capturing the average cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This objective function measures the discrepancy between the true noise added to the data and the noise predicted by the model, aiming to train the model to accurately reverse the diffusion process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Where:&lt;/code&gt; \(x_t\) is the noised image at timestep \(t\), and \(\epsilon_\theta\) is the noise prediction network. Recent works like DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion have demonstrated the remarkable capabilities of diffusion models in text-to-image generation and image editing tasks. These models leverage large-scale training on diverse datasets and incorporate additional conditioning information to enable fine-grained control over generated images.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gans-generative-adversarial-networks&#34;&gt;GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Goodfellow et al. in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other in a zero-sum game framework. The generator aims to generate realistic data samples, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between real and generated samples. The objective functions for GANs can be expressed as follows: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
L_{\text{GAN}} = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_x{\text{data}(x)}} [\log D(x)] + \text{generated data samples}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Where:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$G$ represents the generator network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$D$ represents the discriminator network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$x$ represents the real data sample.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$z$ represents the random noise vector sampled from a prior distribution $p_z(z)$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$p_{\text{data}(x)}$ represents the data distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_x{\text{data}(x)}} [\log D(x)]$ represents the expected value of the discriminator&amp;rsquo;s output for real data samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)} [\log (1 - D(G(z)))]$ represents the expected value of the discriminator&amp;rsquo;s output for generated data samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generator aims to minimize this objective while the discriminator aims to maximize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;self-supervised-learning&#34;&gt;Self-Supervised Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a paradigm in machine learning where the model learns to generate labels from the input data itself, without requiring manually labeled data. This approach uses pretext tasks to learn representations that can be transferred to downstream tasks. One common objective in self-supervised learning is the contrastive loss, which can be expressed as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
L_{\text{contrastive}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(h_i, h_j)/\tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^{2N} \mathbb{1}_{[k \neq i]} \exp(\text{sim}(h_i, h_k)/\tau)}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Where:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$h_i$ and $h_j$ represent the encoded representations of positive pairs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\text{sim}(h_i, h_j)$ represents the similarity measure between $h_i$ and $h_j$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\tau$ represents the temperature parameter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$N$ represents the number of samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\mathbb{1}_{[k \neq i]}$ is an indicator function that is 1 if $k \neq i$ and 0 otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\exp(\text{sim}(h_i, h_j)/\tau)$ represents the exponential of the similarity between the positive pairs scaled by the temperature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The denominator sums the exponential similarities of all pairs except the identical ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This objective encourages the model to bring similar samples closer in the representation space and push dissimilar ones apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adversarial-attacks&#34;&gt;Adversarial Attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
Adversarial attacks involve manipulating input data to deceive machine learning models into making incorrect predictions. One common method is the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), which perturbs the input data in the direction of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input. The formula for generating an adversarial example using FGSM can be expressed as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
x_{\text{adv}} = x + \epsilon \cdot \text{sign}(\nabla_x J(\theta, x, y))
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Where:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$x_{\text{adv}}$ represents the adversarial example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$x$ represents the original input data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\epsilon$ represents the perturbation magnitude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\nabla_x J(\theta, x, y)$ represents the gradient of the loss function $J$ with respect to the input $x$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$J(\theta, x, y)$ represents the loss function of the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\theta$ represents the model parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$y$ represents the true label of the input data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\text{sign}(\nabla_x J(\theta, x, y))$ represents the sign of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input, indicating the direction to perturb the input to maximize the loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The adversarial example $x_{\text{adv}}$ is created by adding this perturbation to the original input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-starting-line&#34;&gt;The Starting Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stood at the starting point of the 2024 IRONMAN 70.3 Bangsaen in Thailand, surrounded by breathtaking coastal scenery, a wave of anticipation and apprehension washed over me. The challenge ahead was daunting, yet exhilarating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-race-breakdown&#34;&gt;The Race Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The triathlon comprised three grueling segments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🏊‍♂️ &lt;strong&gt;1.9km (1.2-mile) swim&lt;/strong&gt; to kick off the journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🚴‍♂️ &lt;strong&gt;90km (56-mile) bike ride&lt;/strong&gt; through scenic routes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🏃‍♂️ &lt;strong&gt;21.1km (13.1-mile) run&lt;/strong&gt; that pushed me to my absolute limits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_IM703_007.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_IM703_008.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_IM703_009.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_IM703_010.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_IM703_014.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these segments totaled an astounding 113km (70.3 miles) of relentless determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_IM703_011.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_IM703_012.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-journey&#34;&gt;The Journey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road to IRONMAN 70.3 Bangsaen was filled with challenges. Each stroke, pedal, and stride pushed me beyond my comfort zone. Moments of doubt and exhaustion tested my resolve, yet each obstacle revealed a reservoir of inner strength I never knew existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_IM703_002.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_IM703_004.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unwavering support of the event staff and my fellow athletes played a pivotal role. Their encouragement and camaraderie fueled my determination and reminded me I wasn’t alone on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-finish-line&#34;&gt;The Finish Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossing the finish line after 7.51 hours was a moment of indescribable joy, relief, and pride. Just moments before the 8.30-hour cutoff, I officially earned the title of IRONMAN 70.3 finisher. It wasn’t just about completing a race; it was about embracing the challenges and pushing beyond my perceived limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_IM703_005.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gear-and-conditions&#34;&gt;Gear and Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equipped with my MERIDA SCULTURA bike and NIKE Zoom Fly 5 shoes, I faced the scorching midday sun, which intensified the already demanding race. Despite the fatigue and heat, sheer determination propelled me forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_IM703_015.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gratitude&#34;&gt;Gratitude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This achievement would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of the IM70.3 Bangsaen organizers and staff. Their support made this dream a reality, and I am deeply grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_IM703_006.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming an IRONMAN wasn’t just a physical feat—it was a testament to perseverance and the resilience of the human spirit. Through this journey, I’ve learned that true strength is discovered in the face of adversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To anyone pursuing a seemingly insurmountable dream, believe in yourself and embrace the challenges. It is through perseverance and determination that dreams transform into reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-celebration&#34;&gt;The Celebration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After crossing the finish line, I rewarded myself with a well-deserved feast of Japanese food and sushi—a delicious acknowledgment of the physical and mental endurance the race demanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/KAO_IM703_013.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happiness I find in this journey lies not just in the end goal but in the process itself—the struggles, triumphs, and growth along the way. To anyone considering a challenging path, embrace it wholeheartedly. Trust in the transformative power of hard work and dedication. In the pursuit of excellence, we find joy and fulfillment that words cannot capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With immense gratitude and pride, I declare: &lt;strong&gt;I am an IRONMAN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS.&lt;/strong&gt; The year began with completing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ironman.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IM70.3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and ended with crossing the finish line at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lagunaphukettri.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laguna Triathlon in Phuket&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which included a 1.8K swim, a 55K bike ride, and a 12K run. Truly, it was a year defined by triathlons for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I reflect on this experience, I feel immense gratitude—for the beauty of Phuket, the camaraderie of my fellow athletes, and the personal growth this race has inspired. The Laguna Phuket Triathlon is more than just an event; it’s a celebration of human spirit and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To anyone considering a triathlon, my advice is simple: go for it. Embrace the challenge, trust your training, and don’t forget to enjoy the ride. Whether you’re a seasoned athlete or a first-timer like me, the journey will leave you stronger, wiser, and more fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,
Kao&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>42.195K at Bangkok Marathon 2022 — My First Full Marathon and Crossing the Finish Line</title>
      <link>https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/blog/2022-11-22-bangkok-marathon-2022conquering-the-full-marathon/</link>

      <guid>https://kaopanboonyuen.github.io/blog/2022-11-22-bangkok-marathon-2022conquering-the-full-marathon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;42195k--the-bangkok-marathon-2022-conquering-the-full-marathon&#34;&gt;42.195K – The Bangkok Marathon 2022: Conquering the Full Marathon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did it. I finally ran a Full Marathon—42.195 kilometers through the streets of Bangkok. It’s still sinking in, but the feeling is electric. This wasn’t just another run; it was a milestone, a test of determination, and an experience I’ll never forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-decision-to-go-the-distance&#34;&gt;The Decision to Go the Distance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of running a full marathon had been on my mind for a while. It’s one of those challenges that, once you’ve thought about it, you can’t shake. I’d done plenty of 5Ks and 10Ks, even completed a half marathon once, but the full 42.195 KM? That was uncharted territory. So, when I finally decided to register for the Bangkok Marathon, it felt like I was committing to something much bigger than just a race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the moment I hit that “register” button, I knew there was no turning back. The excitement was real. Every time I thought about the race, I’d get a little rush of adrenaline, knowing that I was about to push my limits like never before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;training-the-journey-begins&#34;&gt;Training: The Journey Begins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest—my training for this marathon wasn’t exactly textbook. I hadn’t trained for the full distance before. My longest run leading up to race day was a half marathon, and that was just once. Most of my runs were 5K or 10K, and while those were good for keeping in shape, they didn’t fully prepare me for the grueling distance of a full marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was determined. Every time I laced up my running shoes, I reminded myself that this wasn’t just another race. This was the race. My strategy was simple: keep my pace steady, listen to my body, and most importantly, finish strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;race-day-the-big-moment&#34;&gt;Race Day: The Big Moment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Race day arrived with a mix of excitement and nerves. As I stood at the starting line, surrounded by thousands of other runners, I felt the weight of what I was about to do. But more than anything, I felt ready. This was the moment I’d been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started strong, hitting my Sub1 10K goal in 55 minutes. I felt good, my pace was on point, and I was in the zone. But as the kilometers ticked by, the reality of the distance started to set in. From the 10K mark to 21.1K, I slowed down to a steady pace of around 5. I knew I needed to conserve energy for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I hit the 22K mark, things started to change. My legs were getting heavier, and my pace slowed to the point where I was more walking than running. A senior runner even teased me, saying I’d planned to run the first half and walk the second, which, in hindsight, wasn’t too far from the truth. But I kept going, focused on one goal: crossing that finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infamous ‘Devil Km.35’—a point in the race where many runners hit the wall—came and went. Honestly, I was so caught up in the moment that I didn’t even realize I’d passed it. By then, I was walking and chatting with fellow runners, soaking in the atmosphere of this incredible event. The camaraderie, the support, the shared struggle—it all made the experience that much more meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-final-stretch-a-run-to-remember&#34;&gt;The Final Stretch: A Run to Remember&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last 10KM were something special. As I crossed the Rama VIII Bridge just as the sun was rising, I felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. The view was breathtaking, and the realization that I was nearing the finish line gave me a final burst of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, there it was—the Grand Palace, gleaming in the early morning light, marking the end of this incredible journey. Crossing that finish line was one of the most satisfying moments of my life. I’d done it. I’d run my first Full Marathon, all 42.195 kilometers of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participating in the Bangkok Marathon and completing the full marathon distance was an extraordinary achievement that filled me with immense joy and accomplishment. The race challenged me physically, mentally, and emotionally, but it also showcased the resilience, determination, and unwavering spirit within us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossing the finish line was a defining moment that reminded me of the incredible feats we can achieve when we set our minds to it. The memories of this triumphant journey will forever inspire and motivate me to embrace new challenges and strive for greatness in all aspects of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: To the 42.195 KM that changed everything—I’m proud of what I achieved, and I’m already excited for round two. See you at the next finish line!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;42.195K – The Bangkok Marathon 2022: My Journey to the Finish Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment I crossed the finish line at the Bangkok Marathon 2022, a rush of emotions hit me all at once. It was a mixture of exhaustion, disbelief, and joy, but most of all, pride. I had just run 42.195 kilometers, completing my very first full marathon. To many, it may just be a race, but to me, it was a testament to what sheer willpower can achieve. It was fun, exhilarating, and painful all at once. Every stride brought me closer to the finish, but it also pushed me beyond my limits. My legs screamed for mercy, my heart raced faster than I could catch my breath, but I didn’t stop. There was no turning back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training leading up to the marathon had been a rollercoaster. I remember the doubts I had when I first registered. Could I really do it? I had run a few 5Ks and 10Ks, and I even finished a half marathon, but this was something else entirely. A full 42.195K? That felt impossible at first. Yet, the more I trained, the more I realized that it wasn’t about being the fastest—it was about the journey, the perseverance, and the mental toughness to keep going even when everything hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completing the Bangkok Marathon 2022 was more than just a physical achievement. It was a personal triumph. It showed me that I am capable of so much more than I give myself credit for. It reminded me that perseverance and determination are the true markers of success. And it gave me a deep sense of gratitude for every person who cheered me on, every runner I met along the way, and every moment that brought me closer to that finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the journey doesn’t end here. I’m not stopping at one marathon. I will keep running, keep pushing myself, and keep striving for greatness. I’ve tasted the sweet victory of crossing the finish line, and I’m already planning my next challenge. This marathon may be over, but my journey has just begun.&lt;/p&gt;
